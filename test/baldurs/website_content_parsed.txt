also their background and identity Players will be guided through an informative step by step process that allows new players to Dungeons Dragons and other Larian Studios titles to have a full understanding of the choices they are making and to fully immerse themselves into the role of their character Character Creation is a vital first step in playing the game as the choices you make will affect how the world reacts to you and vice versa how you interact with the world The first step to creating a character is to choose from one of 7 Origins These origins can be considered as pre made characters with each character having their own unique story goals personalities and quirks Origins come with pre chosen Races Backgrounds and Classes Some players may opt to make their own custom characters instead but you may miss out on character specific events and dialogue choices Any Origin characters you and your party members don t pick can be encountered while playing the game and become your companions There is one Origin that does not feature a predetermined character The Dark Urge This brand new Origin is the first of it s kind in Larian games Rather than having a set backstory and end objective this Origin introduces and explores the darker impulses that a player may have when playing a role playing game Your character will have no recollection of the past besides walking down a path paved with blood As you venture on your character will find themselves inescapably drawn towards unimaginable cruelties Can you resist these urges You sure can but you may miss the special dialogue and cutscenes associated with the Origin As a character with The Dark Urge players can freely customize their character s Race Background and Class Anyone familiar with Dungeons Dragons knows that the game gives you a myriad of unique choices when it comes to choosing which Races you can play as Baldur s Gate 3 allows players to play as 11 of DnD s most popular Races the Dragonborn Drow Dwarves Elves Githyanki Gnomes Half Elves Half Orcs Halflings Humans and Tieflings Each Race has a set of Racial Features Race specific abilities and perks that range from being proficient in certain weapons to being able to see in the dark to simply having access to spells that you otherwise wouldn t have access to from your class spell list In addition each Race is granted a boost to certain Abilities increasing your character s stats and proficiencies in performing certain actions These Race specific features make choosing your Race an important decision during Character Creation as some Races may be better suited to some Classes than other Races Another big decision in creating your character in Baldur s Gate 3 is choosing which Class to play Baldur s Gate 3 features 12 D D Classes to choose from Barbarian Bard Cleric Druid Fighter Monk Paladin Ranger Rogue Sorcerer Warlock and Wizard You will then be able to pick from a pool of three or more sub Classes of which there are 46 in total across all Classes When you will have to choose your sub Class will depend on your main Class Some require you to choose a sub Class in Character Creation while others only give you a choice after reaching a certain character level Just like in Dungeons Dragons players will be able to multiclass i e adopt two different Classes at the same time While there are a lot of great combinations of Class proficiencies and abilities that you can get from multiclassing there are some drawbacks you should be aware of Firstly Class levels will have to be split among both Classes Players will have a level cap of 12 and the total Class level of both classes cannot exceed this meaning that you may not be able to reach the full potential of either class you are multiclassing In addition you may find that not all Classes will synergize with each other and may find yourself weaker than if you were to focus on a single Class Despite this you are encouraged to experiment and explore any Class combinations you can think up Players will be able to reset and change their Class at an NPC that has not yet been revealed Unlike in DnD where you have to have a certain Ability Score to be able to swap classes Baldur s Gate 3 does not have any restrictions and you can swap between Classes freely without losing any character levels Companions in Baldur s Gate 3 are special NPCs that can be recruited to join the player s party They have their own set of stats abilities equipment lore alignments and more making them unique from one another There are several other Companions you can meet other than the unpicked Origin characters Throughout the game players will meet possible NPCs that can be recruited as a Companion who joins your party if their corresponding conditions are met Unlike in Divinity Original Sin II Companions can be recruited even with a full party These Companions can be found at Camp and can be swapped into the main party roster whenever you visit camp After the first Act however your main party of 4 will have to be set Your companions will each have different objectives and reactions to the actions you choose Learning what they approve of and helping them reach their goals is the first step to developing a Romance with them The developers at Larian Studios hoped to make a Romance system that was more realistic building up throughout each act rather than having them happen at set points in the game The bonds that you develop with your Companions can become so strong that they can be persuaded to follow you even if your path does not align with their beliefs Baldur s Gate 3 s Combat mechanics are heavily inspired by Dungeons Dragons To put it simply dice rolls determine how successful you are in performing actions during combat In more detail the game features a robust and dynamic combat system that combines aspects of turn based combat with real time action Like in Divinity Original Sin II players can freely move their characters during exploration and when approaching an enemy encounter the game seamlessly transitions into turn based combat mode As noted earlier dice rolls determine almost everything in combat The first thing it determines is the turn order Each character within the encounter players companions and enemies alike roll a 20 sided die commonly referred to as the D20 to determine their Initiative Everyone adds their Dexterity Modifier and their position in the turn order depends on how high the resulting number is On your turn you will get to choose an action to take For offensive moves one of two possible dice rolls have to be made depending on the action Most attacks will require an Attack Roll A D20 will be rolled and the sum of the dice roll plus your weapon spell proficiency will be compared to your opponent s Armor Class AC Roll higher than their AC and your attack hits Roll lower and it misses Some attacks require Saving Throws from opponent s instead of an Attack Roll Affected enemies will roll a D20 and add the required modifier to the roll It will be compared to your corresponding Difficulty Class DC and should they roll higher the attack completely fails or it s effects are halved On a successful hit another dice roll will determine how much damage your skill does Of course your damage is not completely left up to chance You will have several set modifiers that will be added to your rolls and as you get higher in level these modifiers and sometimes the number of dice you can roll will increase For any dice roll you make with a D20 whether it be in combat or out of combat rolling a 20 is considered an automatic success while rolling a 1 an automatic failure with the exception of Initiative Baldur s Gate 3 will have three difficulty settings similar to those found in Divinity Original Sin II The default mode is Balanced Mode a mode with just enough storytelling and a good amount of combat for players to experience For players who are more invested into the game s storytelling cinematics and would like easier and shorter enemy encounters Explorer Mode is the one for you The difficulty mode which may excite veterans of Divinity Original Sin II is the returning Tactician Mode Tactician mode is designed for experienced players who seek challenging and strategic experiences In the mode players will encounter enemies with what Larian Studios like to refer to as Brutal AI Enemy creatures become stronger and more adept at countering player tactics They will use advanced strategies exploit weaknesses and coordinate attacks to make battles more difficult An example of this is an enemy specifically targeting the character with the lowest health In addition to this the environment will become more lethal Puzzles and traps become more complex additional environmental hazards such as explosive barrels will be scattered across enemy encounters more enemies may appear in hard to reach areas of arena etc In Tactician Mode players will need to approach encounters with a well thought out plan utilizing the strengths and abilities of every one of their party members Baldur s Gate 3 takes place 100 years after the events in Baldur s Gate 2 and shortly after the events of Descent into Avernus The holy city of Elturel disappeared from the Forgotten Realms and descended into Avernus the first layer of the Nine Hells In the canon of the game it was saved by a party of heroes Baldur s Gate 3 opens with a cinematic of a Mind Flayer infecting a woman with an Illithid parasite on a Nautiloid Your character is infected with the same parasite and after crash landing the aircraft on Faerûn you go an adventure in search of a way to cure yourself As you make your way across the Forgotten Realms you are given a choice between resisting the temptation of the power offered by the Illithid tadpole or fully embracing it Throughout your journey you will meet countless NPCs each with different beliefs alignments and their own story to tell Complete quests reach key story turning points and finish each story arc to make your mark on the world Everything you do will eventually make its way back to the city of Baldur s Gate You will hear the residents of the bustling city making comments on current events and the local Gazette will constantly be updated with your feats Areas from different story acts will be interconnected allowing you to go back and travel back to areas you have visited with ease Of course you will be able to take breaks in between your adventures Take a detour to go Digging for unique equipment and rare treasure Make a stop at Camp to take a Short or Long Rest and speak with your Companions to further your bond with them Get sidetracked and complete Companion Quests and other Side Quests before moving on to the next Main Quest The game is currently available on multiple platforms including PC Steam and GOG PlayStation 5 and GeForce Now Yes you

still in development Released on Steam Stadia and GOG on October 6 2020 Early Access is meant to allow players to give feedback on the game before it is finished and therefore players should expect to encounter bugs unfinished portions and a lack of balancing Players can expect that their feedback will be carefully considered and possibly incorporated into the final product which is usually rather different than the one experienced during Early Access Click to jump to a specific section of the page In terms of being able to play the game and experience its different aspects Early Access will be enjoyable for you if you simply can t wait to experience a Dungeons Dragons game in video game format If you want to see how well the Tabletop Role playing Game could be initially translated into a video game format with all its facets like player progression Class progression combat and actual roleplay choice in dialogues then Early Access will be a good experience for you As previously mentioned however don t expect a fully working game that allows you to play non stop comfortably Early Access is there for players to have a taste of what the game could be while giving developers feedback in terms of what could be improved and what could be added Additionally playing Early Access should mean that you are alright with being spoiled at the beginning of the game s story All that being said if you are the type to want to contribute towards being able to play an amazing game or you simply want to scratch the D D itch early on then Early Access is for you Early Access for Baldur s Gate 3 is approximated to be twenty five to thirty five hours of content filled with Quests different Locations and Act 1 of the game s story Players are able to enjoy a full fledged Character Creation System a Real time with Pause combat system as well as multiple available playstyles in Classes and Subclasses There are eight Races most of which will have Subraces to choose from for your characters which carry with them different Ability Score bonuses Early Access content encompasses just the first Act of the game s story and players can only gain up to five levels at a maximum Players can choose from eleven Classes and two Subclasses later on when they reach a certain level with the exception of the Paladin and Cleric Classes which have three Subclasses each For Early Access players will be able to create their characters with an already full fledged Character Creation system Players will be able to see a preview of their Abilities and Proficiencies on the left side of the screen while customization choices are displayed on the right Customization starts with Origins but players will find all the options greyed out for now aside from the Custom option Players will then be able to choose their character s Race from nine different Races along with a Subrace Afterward players will be able to choose from eleven different Classes as well as other customization options for that class if any including the Subclasses Players will then be able to choose three Skills in which their character will be proficient aside from the ones granted by previous customization choices like their character s Background Subrace or Subclass Players will then be able to fully customize their character s Appearance in a full blown customization system Lastly players will then be able to choose how they want to spread out their points into their character s Abilities There will be twenty seven points in total to distribute There should already be a recommended spread by default in case the player has a hard time choosing Subraces Lolth Sworn Drow Seldarine Drow Subraces Gold Dwarf Shield Dwarf Subraces High Elf Wood Elf Subraces None Subraces

Way of the Open Hand Way of Shadow Way of the Four Elements On full release Baldur s Gate 3 will have an even further revamped Character Creation System at the start of the game This is both in terms of graphics to match the general improvements the developers have made from Early Access and also in terms of its content As listed above the Dragonborn and Half Orc Races will be officially added when the game launches along with the Subraces in Dragonborn s case A new Subrace will also be added for the Dwarf to represent their Underdark dwelling cousins An entire new Class the Monk will be added along with its Subclasses as well as new Subclasses for the already existing Classes for a staggering total number of forty six Subclasses Character s Ability Score bonuses will not anymore come with and depend on their Race but on the chosen Class instead The Appearance customization of Character Creation will also undergo a significant expansion with players able to customize more parts of their character s Appearances with tons of more options and even the option to change their character s Genitals Finally the different Origins will finally be selectable allowing players to experience the game as the characters who are only available as Companions during Early Access The Origin options called The Dark Urge and Karlach will also be added which were not even in the options during

content Baldur s Gate 3 will be released with one hundred to one hundred and twenty hours of gameplay The full version of the game will have a lot of major changes to content story and even most of the dialogues that we ve already seen and played throughout the first Act of the game s story The full game will have a total of three Acts to play through filled with tons of Quests and explorable

that some rules and systems don t translate well directly from tabletop to digital game so Larian has worked to create an interpretation of 5th Edition rules that works well as a digital game but still feels true to D D Yes you will be able to recruit mercenaries Yes but not immediately in Early Access though Sorry but no you will have to start a new adventure in the official release Yes but

an action as a reaction will be added in the official launch Yes there will be a mixture of magic items from published DnD materials and some homebrew items of similar complexity and power level

Early Access supports 4 player online multiplayer but split screen will not be immediately available on launch In 4 player online multiplayer players can either start a multiplayer journey together and both create their own custom character the origin character will not be available as the main player character at the start of Early Access or join a friend s single player game during the adventure In this case they will take over a companion Players will be able to access multiplayer right in the main menu screen by selecting the multiplayer option create a multiplayer lobby and change the option to have only your friends join and lastly invite your friends Once complete simply click on Launch then you and your friends will be able to create your own characters and start into the game However the progress and journey that you and your friends experience will only be saved onto the host s computer That being said the host needs to remain the same and be in the lobby as well If a player disconnects from the lobby control of the character will be assigned to someone else in the party that is still connected The host can simply adjust character assignments by opening the Session Menu Saving the session can be done any time and players will need to make sure to load the same saved game just as like a single player saved session Multiplayer in Baldur s Gate 3 allows players to join their friends adventures or vice versa with one player being the host However there are some basic information players will need to know when wanting to experience the multiplayer option Players will be able to use the same monitor and device to play with a friend in local multiplayer mode as well as having a full controller support Although early access only has online and LAN multiplayer Larian Studios has confirmed that this feature will be available at full release Online multiplayer and Split Screen Co op will have some differences Such as in online multiplayer you can team up with 3 other players to join your session Whereas for Split Screen co op players will be limited to two players sharing one device with multiple controllers Players will need to consider the parameters when playing split screen as it will be a bit more demanding Baldur s Gate 3 will not have a Game Master mode at launch however there is consideration of including a Dungeon Master mode The closest thing to DM mode players can get to is multiplayer mode Although Larian Studios has shown support over modding and community created content so it is possible that they could add a similar mode to their previous game Divinity Original Sin 2 s GM mode in Baldur s Gate 3 Players can still enjoy the game s multiplayer mode to share great experiences of the games storyline and quests with friends through online LAN and split screen multiplayer mode Baldur s Gate 3 will not have crossplay This will not be a feature in Baldur s Gate between PC players and PS5 players However crossplay could be available for players on Windows or MacOS Baldur s Gate 3 will support cross save progression between PC Mac PS5 as well as support for the Steam Deck allowing players to transfer saves between platforms and continue your adventure on the go Unfortunately your Baldur s Gate 3 early access saves will not be carried over to the full game upon release This means players will have to recreate their character once the game has launched and start a new campaign Due to the amount of updates and changed made saves from the early access campaigns will not be compatible with the full version of the game However it is mentioned that there is a loophole where players who begin their playthrough within 72 hours of the release date will have their saves be carried over Saves from July 31 onwards will be compatible with newer versions therefore allowing players to bring over their saved game from early access to the full game Could anyone tell me if I host a multiplayer game can my friend do his own questing and have his own party Obviously story based quests that will alter the progression of the game will carry over but what about character affinity etc 1 0 Hey man bought two copies of the game and my girlfriend cannot connect In when she owns a mac and I a pc It says crossplay between pc and mac but get the game error player has a different version of the game 0 2 WARNING If you allow another player to add a multiplayer character into your game that character can NEVER BE REMOVED FROM YOUR PARTY they CANNOT be sent back to camp You PERMANENTLY lose a slot which could hold a Companion because it will instead hold the multiplayer character FOREVER There is no in game notice that this occurs The only solution is to roll back to a save state before the multiplayer character joined your game 5 0 is this a bug why is this the case 0 0 Page needs an update joining mid campaign makes a new custom character and can t take over a origin or hireling 4 0 I really hope they let you switch between players mid dialogue like you can in single player It sucks when post combat dialogues randomly pick the character who dumped CHA 14 1 Search Results Multiplayer Baldurs

versions of Baldur s Gate 3 please remove them before updating your game You can do this by checking both the Mods and Public folders in SteamApps common Baldurs Gate 3 Data if either of those folders are present please delete them before updating If applicable please also delete the file modsettings lsx in the profile folder Please note that these patch notes are intended as a guide to what is new in Patch 6 of Baldur s Gate 3 They are not exhaustive When it comes to Basic Actions there are a number of improvements that you should take note of First is the new Disengage Action which allows you to retreat from enemies in Melee Range without giving them the chance to perform Attacks of Opportunity This is a significant update because Disengage used to be a part of Jump that doesn t guarantee the prevention of Melee Attacks To make it crystal clear Jump is used to strategically position yourself better in combat whereas Disengage allows you to escape from precarious situations So if you re a Wizard who is caught in the thick of combat you can now use Disengage without worrying if you ll be hit by an Attack of Opportunity or not And second there s a new Non lethal Attack Mode which gives you the option to knock NPCs out without having to kill them So if you wish to steal something from a hapless victim and they re starting to get riled up about it you can just knock them out to pacify them Simple For Spell the most noticeable changes are related to its effects and Concentration These Spell animations and effects are updated and will have a unified look depending on the Class s design that they re a part of Meanwhile Spells which are used by multiple Classes will also be modified to be more similar to those that are Class specific You can also willfully cancel Concentration on a Spell For example you no longer have to suffer the prolonged effects of Fog Cloud Enemy AI is now smarter than ever because they employ more tactical strategies and they possess some of the features available to player characters For instance creatures will do everything in their means to attack you regardless if they have a Weapon or not If enemies are unarmed and they see a Weapon lying around nearby they ll grab it and attack you with it What s cool about this update is how you can use this scenario to your Advantage by disarming your target beforehand This pushes them into a situation where they ll need to utilize Action Points just to run towards and equip a Weapon in order to hit you Furthermore enemy AIs are able to use their resources more efficiently For example they ll carefully plan their next series of attacks so they can still have room to execute other actions like Dash or some Spells in the future They can even use Throw to heal their party members from a distance by hurling Healing Potions at them similar to how a player character would Of course these enhancements will be used by friendly NPCs as well Dice rolls play an active part in whatever action you decide to do may it be in combat or in dialogue In the current setup dice rolls are displayed at the center of the screen when you re talking to NPCs You just hope for the best that you get a favorable roll In the new patch you ll be able to influence its outcome To increase the chances of NPCs agreeing with you you can use your or your Companions Spells But remember that you ll make use of Spell Slots when you cast a Spell so choose wisely So for example you can opt to cast Enhance Ability first to account for the Advantage bonus you get in order to roll twice This raises the chances of tipping the scale in your favor Alternatively Guidance is also a good Spell which also increases your chances for success What makes this more fun is when you re playing with friends because they can decide if they really want to help you by casting a beneficial Spell on you or if they prefer to see you fail You know what some friends are like If you ve been playing Baldur s Gate 3 for quite some time now you ll notice how easy it is to abuse the Long Rest Feature with the simple click of a button Previously you d get instantly teleported into your Camp by the river to restore all of your HP and Spell Slots This could be done after every combat encounter which cheapens these fights as your resources are always topped up This time around in order to take a Long Rest you ll have to gather camp supplies which comprises all of the food and scrap you can buy or steal Heaps of food should go a long way to keep you satiated and ready for the events to come If you re low on supplies you can opt to take a Partial Rest instead This only restores a portion of your HP and Spell Slots but it won t use up any food Moreover your party will also be teleported into different campsites depending on the location You no longer magically exit the Underdark when you want to take a nap Larian has made Mini Camps near major landmarks such as the Chapel near the Ravaged Beach or the Underdark In Patch 5 a huge chunk of the changes stems from the need to improve new player experience On top of the tutorials which start popping out in Character Creation more tooltips will be present after this update These tooltips will be linked to others so it s easier to digest and to understand the game s core concepts and mechanics You can simply hover over one to know more Additionally you even have the option to pin them to your screen so you can easily refer back to it should you have questions about certain terms or actions Backgrounds such as Folk Hero Acolyte and Urchin now matter more than ever and it doesn t end in Character Creation Backgrounds will now have corresponding secret side quests to further flesh out the origin stories of your characters and to accumulate Inspiration Points when you complete them These Inspiration Points can be used to reroll an unfavorable dice roll in dialogue checks You can obtain a maximum of 4 Inspiration Points So when you reach this number any additional points go into extra XP Not only do you discover more about how your character came to be you ll also be rewarded for seeking out these secrets Out of the 5 available Companions in Baldur s Gate 3 Shadowheart will receive a lot of improvements To provide more details about her background new dialogue will be uncovered once you recruit her and once you find out more about her mysterious item Most importantly you can now free Shadowheart during the tutorial The new Point and Click Dialogue System will now allow your character to provide their insights and thoughts on the world the story and the environment during their travels Huge efforts have been made to make this new feature as immersive as possible Dialogue will change depending on the context and the character you re playing as Should you wish to reduce the constant mumbling of your thoughts there s an option to make this less frequent With the power of the wilderness at their fingertips Druids can transform their shape to adapt to different situations says Larian about the newest addition Crunch bones and slam into enemies as a Dire Wolf or Polar Bear Spin your silken thread over the environment as a Spider Soar above Faerun as a Raven Sneak into hostile spaces unnoticed as a Cat Burrow under the earth and ambush opponents as a Badger Or temporarily embrace the tadpole that the Mindflayers have implanted inside you discovering a new mysterious Aberrant Shape Druids will also be able to choose from one of two Circles when influencing how their play experience will be like This optional change helps smooth out the extremes of the bell curve It retains the core elements of RNG ensuring a player can no longer be unlucky or super lucky with several dice rolls in a row The system also runs in two parts Dice rolls in the dialogue are different from those in combat and this change only impacts the d20 Not damage rolls Cinematics in special cases like Speak with Dead have made huge improvements along with the ability to join conversations as an animal The patch also adds improved animations with the Druids in the Grove as they cast spells and use their abilities Major improvements have been made both in animation and lighting Those embarking on their adventure together with friends can now see other players Equipment Spells Inventory and Character Sheets As well as the ability to take and place items to and from There is no lock function that will come in a future patch Your friends could for example steal your items because there s no lock function yet but there s no rush because they re your friends A series of much requested features have been implemented Players can now target friends and enemies with spells and equipment by clicking on their portraits As an alternative to trying to click on a character in the world players can now easily select and attack whoever they want from the UI We also added a flee button for the tacticians among us And using torches has never been easier thanks to the long awaited addition of the torch button Narrative cinematics has been given a new lease of life thanks to a fresh lighting pass resulting in some truly spectacular sequences in which the story of BG3 is told why is censored 0 0 Bardic inspiration randomly seems to disappear without being used even after a long rest 0 0 hows about you add more game give us more acts finish it before you release it in the future 1 31 You still need to adress the devils sight invocation for the Warlock You re still blinded if you re

s Gate 3 brings an immersive and tactical combat experience with is new and old combat mechanics of the game With a combat system combines the aspects of turn based and real time action it follows the ruleset of the Dungeons Dragon s 5th edition Each Class Race and Origin Character gives players a different experience as they vary in Skill Abilities Strengths Weapon set and more Players will experience the environment in real time exploration mode while the game will transition into a turn based combat mode giving players their companions and enemies a turn for combat This gives players more room to plan out their strategy In this guide we will dive deep into the game s combat mechanics to get you up to speed on facing the world of Baldur s Gate 3 Click to jump to a specific section of the page Baldur s Gate 3 features a robust and dynamic combat system that combines aspects of turn based combat with real time action It is based on the Dungeons Dragon s 5th Edition ruleset providing a deep and immersive experience for both newcomers and seasoned players The 5th edition was implemented in 2014 and is the latest version of the pen paper RPG Combat encounters generally start in real time exploration mode where players can freely move their characters and explore the environment When a combat encounter occurs the game seamlessly transitions into turn based combat mode allowing players to strategically plan their actions Each character including the party members and enemies take turns based on their initiative D20 Dexterity modifier During their turn players can perform various actions such as attacking casting Spells using special Abilities or interacting with the environment The effectiveness of these actions depends on the character s attributes Abilities equipment and the success of the dice rolls which adds an element of randomness and unpredictability to the combat In addition to standard attacks characters can also cast Spells which cover a wide range of offensive defensive and utility Abilities Spells have different ranges areas of effect and elements allowing players to tailor their strategies and adapt to carious combat scenarios Additionally the environment can be interacted with enabling creative combinations of spells and environmental effects for additional tactical advantages Throughout the game players will have the opportunity to recruit and maintain a party of adventurers each with unique Abilities and combat styles These party members can be controlled by the player or if desired by AI controlled scripts This adds depth to the combat as players can combine their party members abilities and coordinate their actions strategically Overall Baldur s Gate 3 s combat mechanics offer a challenging and engaging experiences with numerous options for customization strategic planning and creative problem solving Whether you prefer close combat ranged attacks or spellcasting the game provides a variety of options to accommodate different playstyles and encourages experimentation to overcome its dynamic challenges Baldur s Gate 3 gives 3 different difficulty modes Which are Balanced Mode Explorer Mode and Tactician Mode Balance Mode Explorer Mode Tactician Mode Tactician mode is designed for experienced players who seek challenging and strategic experiences In the mode players will encounter tougher enemies enhancing AI and more brutal combat scenarios that require careful planning and tactical decision making Enemy creatures become stronger and more adept at countering player tactics They will use advanced strategies exploit weaknesses and coordinate attacks to make battles more difficult This means that players will need to approach encounters with a well thought out plan utilizing the strengths and abilities of their party members Tactician mode introduces additional challenges outside of combat Puzzles and traps become more complex requiring players to carefully investigate their surroundings and think creatively to overcome obstacles Exploration and resource management also play a crucial role With limited resources available players must decide when and how to use their healing potions spells and abilities to maximize their chances of success The environment in Tactician mode is highly dynamic and reactive to players actions The game world responds realistically to the choices players make and their decisions have far reaching consequences These choices can affect the outcome of quests alter relationships with NPCs and shape the overall narrative Additionally Tactician mode encourages players to dive deeper into the intricate RPG mechanics and character customization options available in the game Players will need to carefully choose their party composition taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of each character Effective us of character abilities spells and synergies will be essential for survival Companions are NPCs that can be recruited to join the player s party they are characters with their own backgrounds personalities and storylines They are meant to be integral members of your adventuring party joining you on your journey and becoming allies and friends along the way These companions are designed to have in depth interactions conversations and even romances with the player s character enhancing the immersion and narrative depth of the game Each companion has their own specific set of Skills Abilities and Classes which can greatly impact both combat and non combat situations They provide extra hands in battles offering unique strategies and support and their individual abilities often complement the player s own skills Companions can also contribute to discussions offering their unique perspectives and insights which can lead to different outcomes and quest paths Companions possess their own personal quests and storylines which can deepen your understanding of their characters and lead to significant consequences for both the narrative and gameplay Building relationships with companions through dialogue choices actions and bonding moments can significantly impact their loyalty and the overall direction of the story Hirelings are independent individuals that can be recruited by the player to assist in their quests and battles They lack the full background story and intricate character development found in companions but they make up for this by offering versatility and freedom in terms of customizations and playstyle Hirelings come in handy when all your companions either get killed in battle or by you or if they decide to leave the party They are party members that players can customize to fit their party how they see fit Hirelings are there to support your character in quests There are 12 hirelings available in the game for players one for each class Hirelings are also customizable in build and appearance Although hirelings might not have the same depth of interaction as companions they can still offer valuable support and power in combat scenarios They can be controlled and directed in battle allowing players to capitalize on their unique abilities and create powerful synergies with their team Dungeons and Dragons uses a system that involves the rolling of a 20 sided die This die is called the D20 to resolve encounters and scenarios on the game world It is a fundamental component of the game mechanics used to resolve various actions including combat encounters skill checks and savings throws Baldur s Gate 3 is based on the Dungeons Dragons 5th Edition tabletop role playing game which utilizes the D20 system as its core mechanic It determines the success of failure of various actions taken by characters within the game world When a player attempts a specific action that requires a roll such as attacking an enemy the game uses the D20 system to generate a random number between 1 and 20 To determine success the game adds various modifiers such as a character s proficiency bonus ability scores and other situational bonuses or penalties If the final result of the roll plus modifiers meets or exceeds a specific Difficulty Class DC or an opponent s Armor Class AC the action succeeds If the total is lower than the DC or AC the action fails This provides an element of chance and randomness to the game simulating the unpredictability of real life scenarios The use of the D20 system in Baldur s Gate 3 closely mirrors the rules and mechanics of D D It allows players to experience the tactical decision making and character progression associated with traditional D D gameplay Each character in the game has a designated class which determines their available Skills Abilities and proficiencies The D20 system is then utilized to resolve conflicts and challenges in a fair and balanced manner This system also extends to important non combat interactions such as dialog options persuasion attempts and exploration When a player attempts to persuade an NPC for example the success of their persuasion roll is determined using the D20 system This helps create a sense of tension as players must weigh the odds of success or failure before making decisions than can significantly impact the game s narrative and outcomes In the current setup dice rolls are displayed at the center of the screen when you re talking to NPCs You just hope for the best that you get a favorable roll In the new PATCH 5 you ll be able to influence its outcome To increase the chances of NPCs agreeing with you you can use your or your Companions Spells But remember that you ll make use of Spell Slots when you cast a Spell so choose wisely So for example you can opt to cast Enhance Ability first to account for the Advantage bonus you get in order to roll twice This raises the chances of tipping the scale in your favor Alternatively Guidance is also a good Spell which also increases your chances for success Attack rolls occur when a character is attacking another character The attacking character rolls the d20 and if the roll is equal or higher than the target s Armor Class AC then that attack hits the target with the equipped weapon Melee weapons use the Strength ability modifier while Ranged Weapons use the Dexterity ability modifier There are some exceptions such as melee weapons that have the finesse property These melee weapons use Dexterity instead of Strength If you successfully connect the attack your ability modifier is then added to your damage roll Damage rolls are calculated by rolling the die or dice of the weapon used and then adding the ability modifier for example a weapon deals 2d6 damage means you roll a 6 sided die twice This means that you are not only more likely to hit with the weapon if you have high Strength or Dexterity but you will do more damage if you do This optional change will help smooth out the extremes of the bell curve It retains the core elements of RNG ensuring a player can no longer be unlucky or super lucky with several dice rolls in a row The system also runs in two parts dice rolls in dialogue are different to those in combat and this change only impacts the D20 not damage rolls When you attack from above you gain a 2 bonus to the Attack Roll When you attack from below you have a 2 penalty The height difference between you and your target must be at least 2 5m Advantage and disadvantage are applied to the roll of the D20 Advantage means that you roll the D20 two times when making an Attack Roll Ability Check or Saving Throw and use the higher of the two values On the other hand disadvantage means that you roll the d20 two times but in this case use the lower of the two values Disadvantage is one of the worst situations you can be on when rolling on D D and should be avoided at all costs While advantage nearly doubles your chance of success and should be sought out Having extra rolls will either make or break your chances to hit the target accordingly The mechanics of savings throws are an essential aspect of the game s combat and interaction systems A saving throw is a roll made by a character to resist or specific effect that could potentially harm or hinder them It is usually triggered by certain spells abilities or environment related effects When an effect or ability requires a character to make a saving throw the game calculates the defense of a character against many effects or Spells Each character has six core attributes Strength Dexterity Constitution Intelligence Wisdom and Charisma These attributes determine the character s modifiers which are added to the saving throw result To make a saving throw the player rolls a D20 The result of the roll is then adjusted by the corresponding ability modifier and any relevant bonuses or penalties The DC is determined by the effects of the spell or ability that triggered the saving throw These Spells or effects will target one of the six Abilities of the player and they will use that specific ability modifier when rolling Just like ability checks and attack rolls you must hit the target number or higher in order to succeed If you are making a spellcasting character such as a Wizard or Sorcerer it is beneficial to prioritize increasing the ability score used for your spellcasting which will make it less likely for another creature to succeed on a saving throw against your spell save DC Such as is the case with Weapons each Spellcasting class and subclass uses a different Ability that is used to calculate the Spellcasting Ability modifier The DC to resist one of your spells is calculated as 8 your Proficiency Bonus your Spellcasting Ability Modifier For example a 5th level Druid casts the 3rd level spell Call Lightning around a group of Goblins forcing these Goblins to make a Dexterity saving throw At 5th level the Druid likely has a Wisdom score of 18 or 19 so they have a Proficiency Bonus of 3 and a Spellcasting Ability Modifier of 4 This means the Save DC of this Spell is 15 8 3 4 A Goblin who doesn t roll at least a 15 fails the save and takes 3d10 lightning damage the sum of three rolls of a d10 die and a Goblin takes half that damage on a successful save All characters in D D 5th edition have what it s called a Proficiency Bonus This is a positive modifier that increases as your character gains levels and work somewhat similarly to ability modifiers because it is added to D20 rolls Each player character begins the game with a proficiency level of 2 increasing 1 every four levels to a maximum of 6 Proficiency bonus is the same for all characters at the same level regardless of Class or Race Proficiency bonus is only added to your D20 rolls of things that you have proficiency in These are determined by your Race Class Background and Feats This means that you will only get this roll at things your character is good at For example Proficiency bonus is not added to the damage roll Armor Class is what protects you from any attack that uses an attack roll Spells included The amount of protection you gain depends on how heavy the armor you are wearing For example Padded Armor gives you 11 AC which means an enemy must reach a total of 11 on the attack roll in order hit you When wearing lighter armor players gain a benefit to their armor class from their Dexterity When wearing Light Armor you gain the full value of your Dexterity modifier added to your Armor Class When wearing Medium Armor you gain up to 2 AC from your Dexterity modifier and when wearing Heavy Armor you gain no benefit from your Dexterity modifier at all Unlike Weapons proficiency in an armor type is a must have or you ll be facing some serious penalties Characters who wear armor they aren t proficient in will have disadvantage on any Ability Check Saving Throw or Attack Roll that involves Strength or Dexterity and they can t cast Spells The other two important things to pay attention when wearing armor is whether or not they give you disadvantage on Stealth checks and when using Heavy Armor whether there is a Strength requirement or not As of Patch 5 you can now perform nonlethal attacks This allows you more flexibility during Quests allowing you to knockout characters that you don t want to kill leading to more diverse branching paths Difficulty Class DC represents the level of difficulty or challenge associated with various actions such as attacking casting spells or performing skill checks It is mainly used to determine the probability of success or failure when engaging in these activities The DC is typically expressed as a number that needs to be equal to or exceeded on a D20 roll to successfully complete and action When attempting an attack or ability check the character s relevant modifiers statistics and proficiency bonus are added to the D20 toll to determine the overall value compared to the difficulty class When a character attempts to perform a skill check the difficulty class determines the level of difficulty associated with the task The character rolls a D20 adds relevant modifiers such as their skill proficiency and attribute bonuses and compares the final result to the skill check s DC If the total value equals or exceeds the DC the player succeeds in the task Otherwise they fail The difficulty class in Baldur s Gate 2 can vary depending on the action being attempted the level of the characters involved and the specific circumstances As characters progress and become more powerful they may also encounter the higher DCs required more successful rolls to overcome various challenges in the game In 5th edition D D players do not receive a penalty for attacking with Weapons they are not proficient with but instead do not gain their proficiency bonus And when using Armor or Shields they are not proficient with they have disadvantage on any ability check saving throw or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity and they cannot cast Spells Using armors you are not proficient with should be avoided at all costs In Baldur s Gate 3 you can use any weapon you wish on any character but you will not gain your proficiency bonus when attacking if you aren t proficient with said weapon You won t be penalized for using a weapon you are not proficient with but the likelihood of hitting an enemy is reduced because you don t get the added benefit of proficiency Every characters Weapon proficiency is determined by their Race and Classes some of those weapons also benefit specific Races For example Elves gain proficiency with Longswords Shortswords shortbows and longbows Wizards gain proficiency with Daggers Darts Slings Quarterstaffs and Light Crossbows This means that if you create an Elven Wizard you ll have proficiency with all 9 of those weapon types Each Weapon has a damage type a is either Bludgeoning Piercing or Slashing This is something to be aware of because some Enemies have damage reductions to certain types of damage Each weapon has a set of skills players can activate in their battles However these skills can only be used once when out and about in the world and can be recharged by resting at a campsite Players will need to Each Armor piece has their own level of armor regardless of it being Light Armor Medium Armor Heavy Armor or Clothing each armor s proficiency also varies depending on the players class es Classes that have more martial focus lean to have more armor proficiencies while spellcasters lean to have fewer armor proficiencies Players will suffer a huge disadvantage in making any Strength or Dexterity based Ability Checks Attack Rolls or Saving Throws as well as inability to cast spells if you wear Armor that you are not proficient with Legendary Items are the highest tier item in Baldur s Gate 3 these Legendary Items are extremely powerful and puts you on a journey to find There are a total of 9 Legendary Items for the 12 different Classes to use since there are equipment that can be used between the different Classes such as Greatswords or Longswords There are some items in Baldur s Gate 3 that are only accessible for players who play the origin character The Dark Urge players will not be able to retrieve the item unless they play as The Dark Urge since that character is not available for recruitment It s the number that represents each ability stat of your character On the other hand ability modifier is the bonus or penalty you gain from your ability score of each ability To determine an ability modifier subtract 10 to the ability score then divide the result by two rounded down For example if you have 21 Strength your ability score is 21 and your ability modifier is 5 21 10 2 5 5 rounded down to 5 If you have 6 Wisdom then your Ability Score is 6 and your ability modifier is 2 6 10 2 2 Both ability scores and ability modifiers determines how successful your character is at various things throughout the game Baldur s Gate 3 introduced a comprehensive reaction system to enhance the depth of gameplay and create more realistic and immersive interactions between characters When your character has the opportunity to react a popup box will appear allowing you to chose what you want to do Note a counter spell requires spell slot Players can now use reactions to cast Counterspell when an enemy tries to cast a spell This creates a new layer of tactical decisions allowing players to react to enemy spellcasting and potentially thwart their plans Feats in Baldur s Gate 3 work like talents or perks in other RPGs giving the character a very specific bonus Players don t gain Feats automatically Players gain an Ability Score point every 4 levels At level 4 8 12 16 and finally 19 and can opt out of this ability score improvement to instead take a Feat Humans and Fighters gain additional Feats Feats in the game are generally tied to specific playstyles or character classes allowing players to further specialize their characters based on their preferred strategies or roles within the party Each feat offers a distinct advantage or benefit that can greatly impact gameplay Not all Feats can be used by everyone the Heavily Armored Feat for example requires to have Medium Armor Proficiency to be unlocked Baldur s Gate 3 features a complex and varied spellcasting system that allows players to utilize

spellcasting subclasses Eldritch Knight Fighter and Arcane Trickster Rogue Each class has its own spell list unique spells and progression offering a diverse range of magical abilities for players to explore Spells of 1st level and higher represent more powerful spells requiring spell slots of an appropriate level to cast These spell slots are usually restored by finishing a Long Rest but some classes have features providing partial restoration Cantrips are spells that can be cast at will without expending spell slots Offensive cantrips are on par with weapon attacks while often including secondary effects and defensive and utility cantrips often provide boosts to d20 rolls Spellcasting classes like Wizards and Clerics have the ability to prepare spells allowing players to choose spells from their available spell list and allocate them to their available spell slots This allows for tactical decision making and adaptability in different situations Spells range from 1st to 9th level Cantrips being considered 0 level spells Higher level spells tend to have more potent effects but require higher level spell slots to cast As players level up you gain access to higher level spells and additional spell slots Character level doesn t correspond to spell level and the rate of progression differs among some classes and subclasses The effectiveness of spells is often determined by the character s spellcasting ability which varies based on their class Modifiers based on the relevant ability score are used to calculate spell save DC and spell attack bonuses Spells can target various types of entities including enemies allies or the caster themselves Spells can also have different areas of effect such as single target spells cone shaped spells or large scale area of effect spells that affect multiple creatures Baldur s Gate 3 showcases a highly interactive environment Spells can interact with surroundings leading to unique interactions and tactical

Create Wiki Back to top Character Creation in Baldur s Gate 3 covers information regarding the customization mechanic for creating a character The customization may allow you to freely choose the appearance of your character from selecting the gender and race to choosing various parts of the facial structure body appearance and many more Character Customization in Baldur s Gate 3 expands beyond simple aesthetic choices but creates the personality and the core of the character which will in turn affect the game The game will react to your character combination based on your Race Background and Class This will further affect your available Abilities Proficiencies dialogue options and how your character interacts with different environments and personalities in the game along with the success rate of their interactions How you create your character will determine how the game reacts to you Character Creation is where players can create their own Builds and view details and traits that can define created characters Click to jump to a specific section of the page The Character Creation process in Baldur s Gate 3 features a few steps where players can customize each section before proceeding to the next stage This is more than just aesthetic or appearance preferences Developers have emphasized how the game reacts to your character based on who they are Players will not only be creating a character and deciding on how they look but also defining their identity during this stage which includes the character s history Baldur s Gate 3 really expands on the different interactive elements of the game making sure the experiences are unique for each character since the game relies on the narrative of the game This means you can modify your character and play through the game again with another Character Creation and have a different experience especially now that multiclassing is being implemented Choosing different Backgrounds will also give players access to unique Quests that wouldn t otherwise be experienced unless they play through each of the available character options Your choices begin from Character Creation and affect your available interactions which will then further shape the narrative and the trajectory of the story It has been confirmed that Multiclassing is a feature that will be introduced in Baldur s Gate 3 Multiclassing is the ability to switch to another character Players will now be able to make changes and completely reset their Class in game after encountering an in game character without having to restart the game and undergo the Character Creation process again Players who have played through the Early Acess may find this character familiar and he can be encountered int eh early stages of Act 1 This allows players to then reinvest all their levels without having to put in an extensive amount of extra effort starting from the beginning and no longer have any Ability Score requirements This encourages players to experiment with multiclassing and gives them more freedom when creating a Build In Baldur s Gate 3 you will be able to Respec your characters as many times as you want as long as they you the required gold and have already added Withers to the Camp Approach to him and select Respec among the services he provides Withers will ask for 100 gold pieces for his service The price of the service DOES NOT increase during the course of the game nor if you use it frequently Any character can interact with Withers to Respec even your Companions if they pay the asking price Note that respecing a character does not change its interactions or Quests A look into the Character Creation page quickly shows the notable difference from the initial Character Creation menus seen on Baldur s Gate 3 Early Access This was newly organized to clearly present all needed information about the selections of each step in the creation This layout makes the early game process more inclusive to players new to the Dungeons Dragon games so that they get a better idea of what choices made during these initial steps could impact later on in the game Big games like Baldur s Gate 3 will contain a lot of information for new players to process and the developers were looking to capture a wider audience so this layout breaks it down a little easier in a step by step process to welcome and encourage new players to play the game and be immersed from the start of the game Players who wish to go through the first playthrough blind of without guides might not need to note the items in game since they will learn about them as they are encountered but those who wish to thoroughly plan out their Build can now refer to all available Items Weapons and Armor to see how they are obtained or for which Class Races or Background would best suit any items you would want to use View all Items Weapons and Armor on their respective page how to get them and if they have any requirements then you can focus your Build on that However as you progress through the game and gain better items your Build can evolve along with your items especially with the implemented Multiclassing feature and the ability to Respecc After your character is created you will have a chance to choose Who do you dream of Who attracts you This choice does not limit your romance options in game However while camping at night you will have dreams featuring this mysterious entity Baldur s Gate 3 offers a new in depth Character Creation and Customization system to give players the ability to express how they want to portray their characters and make their imaginations a reality which is an important aspect in all Dungeons Dragon games This gives players additional customization options that adjust according to the chosen Race After choosing the desired race players can customize unique features found on the character such as Horns and Tails which are not found on all characters This also introduces the two new Races in the game Half Orc and Dragonborn which each display unique characteristics attachments and appearances that can be customized This expands the appearance possibilities and allows for more freedom expression when creating unique looks for each character Your character s identity is the core of the game and your interactions in the game revolve around who you have created which is why it was important to pay such attention to details to the character creating process at the start of the game The creation of your character is part of the experience and your choices during this stage will further impact your experiences and choices as you play It is important that players had a lot of room for expression during this stage to match the desired appearances with each character s identity The Character Creation appearances menu includes a large palette of colors and customizability from the hair eyes and skin and additional details specific to certain races like horns tails and jaw structure Additional details were also given attention allowing players to not only add specific minor details but also adjust the intensity of them This includes being able to adjust the maturity and the intensity of the freckles on the character if any During the showcase viewers also witness the customization process and a rundown of the different menu options Viewers noticed an option to customize the character s genitalia and the ability to toggle Hide Clothes to see the effects of the changes Developers did not pinpoint the feature but it was seen on the appearance customization menu All in all this displays the great lengths and extensiveness of the customization abilities in the game taking into account different conditions for inclusivity and variety such as Vitiligo and Heterochromia The developers were happy to announce the introduction of a few new Races to the Baldur s Gate roster Players can play as Half Orc and Dragonborn characters if they want to elevate their fantasy experience Developers paid special attention to details when creating and designing the Dragonborn which was the most technically challenging since they are the most diverse and furthest from the other humanoid races Developers had to consider the different ways the details of the Dragonborn can vary and how their scales react to the lighting They ve expressed giving the lighter shades and white colours additional attention by adding a pearlescent finish Origins are like pre made Characters that can be selected during Character Creation if players do not wish to undergo specific Customization options Each Origin character will have different backgrounds and Classes that will also affect gameplay and interactions Players who want to be a part of each step of the customization can opt for a Custom character while on this menu Players who choose not to go with an Origin character may have a chance to engage with them as Companions except for The Dark Urge Rogue High Elf Noble Githyanki Fighter Soldier Human Wizard Sage High Half Elf Cleric Trickery Domain Urchin Human Warlock The Fiend Asmodeus Tiefling Barbarian Players can toggle and modify a variety of individual features for their character These customization options may vary depending on your character selection choices and character Race Players can also opt to randomize their features and modify them from there The following customization options are edited with a slider to determine how intense or how much of the following features players would like to see on their character Aside from the general customization options players can also choose to further modify other specific features on their character Each section will have a dedicated menu for customizing each part and feature The available menu options may change depending on your Race choice for example Dragonborn characters will have an added Tail customization option menu while Tiefling characters have horns that can also be customized Baldurs Gate 3 adds new races to the game for players to experience Players can now choose to create Dragonborn or Half Orc characters which provides a whole new set of Subrace options as well as additional appearance customization options including additional Chin and Jaw details and Tail features Select from a variety of Races available in Baldur s Gate 3 Hover over each Race in order to display their in game description while undergoing the Character Creation process This will also display their available Race Features and will determine the options available for the next step in Character Creation when choosing a Subrace which will be directly related to your selected Race Choosing a Race in Baldur s Gate 3 now differs from tabletop gameplay When choosing a Race players had to consider the appropriate Ability Scores that would best suit their desired class with some being obviously better matches than others In Baldur s Gate 3 developers wanted to remove these constrictions so your Class can be considered a little less when choosing a Race This is to encourage players to experiment and have fun with the different Race and Class combinations without much consequences when it comes to their stats Instead when choosing a Race players can consider their interactions and dialogue options during gameplay and focus on the available Race Features that come with each Race which will be displayed just below the Race description during the Race selection menu in Character Creation Players can also look at the character bar on the right when creating a character to take a look at the Proficiencies your choices give you You can take into account which Weapons you generally gravitate towards or which Weapons will best suit your playstyle and then adjust your Race options according to which ones will give you the proficiency for your preferred Weapon or Equipment If you choose a race that happens to not have the proficiency you need you can also browse through the Classes and Backgrounds to gain the Proficiency you are looking for Another thing to consider is the size of your Race and character since this will actually affect your movement speed This will be most noticeable during Combat To sum it up when choosing a Race consider a few factors when moving forward This could be adjusted anytime while in the Character Creation menu before you proceed Players can also consider trying the newly added Races for a new experience Things to Consider when Choosing a Race From the Character Creation Classes menu players will be able to access each Class s description Actions and Class Features Click on the details button for more details when choosing a class Developers have announced during their Panel from Hell Release Showcase that players will have a chance to meet an in game character that can be interacted with and allows you to change your class mid game without having to restart the whole game Players can then experiment with Multi classing and decide which Classes best complement each other through gameplay When choosing a Class you will want to look at the available Subclasses that each Class has to offer Once you have chosen a class you can start distributing your Ability Scores You can be a certain Ability Point centered version of your character by assigning your Ability Points According across Strength Dexterity Constitution Intelligence Wisdom and Charisma depending on what type of combat or interactions you want to have This will further affect how you will play the game where you position your character and whether you are a tank at the frontlines of combat or not Those who prefer Melee Combat will go for Strength Intelligence or Constitution for heavier Armor equipment and better HP stats while a ranged warrior will go for Dexterity instead rather than strength This is just an example of how you can approach creating a build This respect or multiclassing feature allows players to reallocate Attribute points in order to modify their Builds mid game Players can keep in mind that even when they choose a class in Character Creation it will not prevent them from trying other classes later on This is done through an NPC interaction that is encountered early game After selecting a Class during character creation players can further customize their character classes from the Subclass menu which is specific to the chosen Class Each Class will have a dedicated set of subclasses to choose from which will affect your available Actions and will give you a Subclass Feature Additional Customization may also appear once you have selected your desired Subclass Backgrounds determine each character s starting Proficiencies and will affect the success of their interactions in game All Backgrounds will be available regardless of which Race or Class is chosen After going through each of the Character Creation steps modifying and customizing your character s appearances and choosing their Race Class Subclass and Background along with each corresponding additional customization menu that appears you will have your final results displayed on the right side of your displayed character that you have created This displays your character s final starting Stats Cantrips Actions and Proficiencies Players can then review all this information before proceeding The initial Character Creation process is when players have the opportunity to create a build Serious players can take a look at all the stats affected by the changes in each aspect after every step of the creation process Players can also consider what their playstyle or combat style is when undergoing each step To break it down players can choose which parts they want to prioritize whether there is a particular Race Background or Class they want to play Everything else can be chosen to complement that in a build Players usually start off by choosing a desired Race and then choose a Class to suit the Race After this process you can take a look at how to increase your Ability Scores Race is a very important choice in character creation because it affects your itemization and could make items perform better depending on your Race Choose carefully because though multiclassing is an added feature players will be unable to change their Race Casual players who just want to play a game can refer to pre made Builds made or recommended by other players These are usually made considering different playstyles The Build page has a number of builds and recommendations anyone can try out Players can also consider choosing from the available Origins in Character Creation The reason it s important to select Races that increase your Ability Score for the primary Ability of your Class is that you want to hit 16 in that Ability during Character Creation 99 of the time You can only hit 15 without gaining a boost from your Race during Character Creation so this makes it pretty much a must Odd Ability Scores don t provide you with any extra benefit so it s important you get that additional point to get to 16 to get and extra 1 to your Attack Rolls Damage Rolls or Spell DC as well as Saving Throws and other bonuses No matter what Build you select it s a good idea to aim for even values during Character Creation and shoot for getting your Primary Attribute to 16 The Best Builds in Baldur s Gate 3 focus on optimizing Character Creation with the intention of min maxing knowing exactly how many Levels each Build can take and how many Levels of each Class are needed in the case of Multiclassing Trial and error is needed to achieve this in many cases since enemy composition plays a role in what Spells and Class Features are more useful than others Tailoring Builds to the exact things you ll be facing in Baldur s Gate 3 is a huge part of what makes specific Builds better than ones you might find in regular DnD 5E If you re looking for the Best Builds in Baldur s Gate 3 you can choose from any of the following Best Melee Builds Best Ranged Builds Players also have the option to choose an Origin at the start of Character Creation if they don t prefer to make a custom build Origin Characters are pre designed characters that are selected during Character Creation where players can step into the shoes of these pre made characters and start their adventure Origin Characters for Baldur s Gate 3 are equipped with stats unique personal backstories exclusive quests motivations and distinct interactions with the world This is an advantage to better understand the lore and background for each of the available Origin Characters If you choose not to play as an Origin character some of these Origin character may also then be encountered and recruited as a Companion Astarion prowled the night as a vampire spawn for centuries serving a sadistic master until he was snatched away Now he can walk in the light but can he leave his wicked past behind Lae zel is a consummate warrior ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy Lae zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people Gale has one ambition to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest counting down to an explosion that can level a city One of Shar s dark disciples Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power While wrestling with her faith and strange untamed magic Shadowheart has enemies on all sides Noble by birth Wyll made his name as the heroic Blade of Frontiers He keeps his pact with a devil well hidden and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal Fresh escaped from Hell Karlach is finally free of the archdevil Zariel but not from the infernal engine Zariel planted in her chest But even more premier in her mind Exploring finding like minded travelers falling in love or lust You remember nothing of your past besides that you walked a path paved with blood As you venture on you find yourself inescapably drawn towards unimaginable cruelties Where do these thoughts come from During the Panel from Hell showcase it was revealed that The Dark Urge is the additional origin character that players can select in the Character Creation section of the game Unlike other Origin Characters The Dark Urge is a fully customizable Origin avatar where players can play as whichever Race Class appearance gender and overall build that they would like while maintaining the origin story of The Dark Urge The Dark Urge origin is also not associated with any Companions in Baldur s Gate 3 Customized The Dark Urge avatar selected by chat during the Panel of Hell showcase The Dark Urge is quite unique in Baldur s Gate 3 since the sequences and interactions that are featured are unexpected and it challenges your perception of how to tackle different situations As you choose to play the origin of The Dark Urge its history is unknown but you awaken to be someone who has dark thoughts that plague your mind and ultimately push you to commit atrocious acts throughout the journey The choice is completely yours will you fight what is twisting your mind to be good or will you succumb to madness and wreak chaos Upon starting your journey with the origin of The Dark Urge the story will include a sinister voice of a narrator that speaks of the different impulses that are going on in your character s mind This unique feature alone changes the many ways of interactions as well as cutscenes that you haven t seen and dialogues for you to choose from and at length its origin story that unfolds As The Dark Urge we highly recommend that players enjoy every cutscene and dialogue there is available to it Yes the choice is completely yours if you play the origin of The Dark Urge Unlike any other characters or even the player s customized avatar the Dark Urge will have its own unique cutscenes and dialogue options for different scenarios and whatever you choose will result in different outcomes One example that was featured during the Panel from Hell showcase was during the exploration of a crash site with Shadowheart the player starts to loot the bodies of goblins and a cutscene triggers where the Narrator reminds you of how the sight of blood and violence gives you pleasure You then choose if you try to push the smile away to let that grin fall across your face or with enough Intelligence you try to remember the last time you stood above a corpse Another example is when Gale reaches his hand out from a portal and asks for help you are given unique choices such as fantasizing about cutting off the hand and by doing so your urges have led you to hacking off his hand With this you acquire Gale s severed hand which is a new branching point of interaction and scenarios that are unique and exclusive to The Dark Urge origin As you dive into its origin you ll learn what causes these twisted thoughts and experience the dark counterpoint of the game s main storyline If you are having trouble picking your race use this table to compare the racial attributes available in BG3 Sub races have minor changes that you may also want to consider as

characters that are selected during Character Creation where players can step into the shoes of these pre made characters and start their adventure Origin Characters for Baldur s Gate 3 are equipped with stats unique personal backstories exclusive quests motivations and distinct interactions with the world This is an advantage to better understand the lore and background for each of the available Origin Characters If they are recruited as Companions their previous experiences and attitudes will influence their opinion about what you should do and how you should behave This also includes that everything that you choose to speak of and actions that you choose to do will influence the relationship which determines if you ll become friends lovers rivals or bitter enemies as well as your progression in the story During the Panel from Hell showcase it was revealed that The Dark Urge is the additional origin character that players can select in the Character Creation section of the game Unlike other Origin Characters The Dark Urge is a fully customizable Origin avatar where players can play as whichever Race Class appearance gender and overall build that they would like while

cannot be recruited as a Companion It is exclusively selected during the Character Creation section of Baldur s Gate 3 where players customize the origin avatar and experience the path of The Dark Urge Players can change their class and race to whatever they want Yes you can run into a character in the game that is The Dark Urge where you can interact with but as mentioned this NPC that you ll eventually bump into cannot be recruited as a Companion Upon starting your journey with the origin of The Dark Urge the story will include a sinister voice of a narrator that speaks of the different impulses that are going on in your character s mind This unique feature alone changes the many ways of interactions as well as cutscenes that you haven t seen and dialogues for you to choose from

Dark Urge you ll be thrown with evil thoughts and sinister actions that question your judgment or simply if you want to explore your darkest thoughts Some people may find this unappealing since they prefer to project their personality and beliefs towards the character they ve created but if you do play as The Dark Urge it is possible to use these ominous actions to your advantage The

aspects of a character from their appearance to their innate capabilities BG3 Races are chosen during Character Creation and each choice grants various buffs and effects that are exclusive to a certain race as well as unique physical traits Players looking to optimize their Builds will take into account character race as well as Background and Class Below you can find the full list of all Baldur s Gate 3 Races Sub Races and their special abilities features and possible attribute boosts Click to jump to a specific section of the page Picking your race is an important choice in BG3 as it will impact your character s appearance and background to an extent Your race and the associated civilization may change npc s perception of your character Your Baldur s Gate 3 Race choice also determines specific effects and thus impacts your Build Racial Features Draconic Ancestry Base Racial Speed The Dragonborn race are descendants of dragons and to which they share many of their traits and racial features They possess the Draconic Ancestry that allows them to breathe fire acids lightning poison ice and others Each of the Dragonborn corresponds to the ten types of dragons that you can find in Dungeons and Dragons The Dragonborns possess the Breath Weapon which gives them the power to breathe destructive energy The damage dealt in an area is based on the ancestry and players may only use this attack once until they complete a long rest The Dragonborn race is distantly related to a particular kind of dragon This will determine the type of damage the area of the Breath Weapon

Dragonborn Racial Features Base Racial Speed Drow Weapon Training Superior Darkvision and Fey Ancestry Perception Proficiency In the world of Faerûn the Drow presents a dark elven race with a history of conflict between the two Elven deities After Lolth was found guilty of high treachery she was banished into the Underdark by her own elven kind where she conquered the deep abyss and regained powers for herself After millennia of war between the elves that caused endless bloody conflict the other Elves have decided to turn all the Dark Elves indiscriminately into Drow into what they are today in Dungeons and Dragons Subraces Raised by Lolth s cult in the city of Menzoberranzan this Drow race extols the virtues of their corrupt and merciless goddess Lolth marks her followers with bright red eyes so the Underdark will leam to fear drow on sight Drow is the result of an ancient schism between the elven deities Corellon Larethian and Lolth The latter s treachery drove the drow into the Underdark where they splintered into warring factions Seldarine Drow can be found seeking allies from all over Faerün aiming to settle their conflict with Lolth and each other by any means necessary Racial Features Base Racial Speed Dwarven Combat Training Darkvision and Dwarven Resilience Subraces Gold dwarves are known for their confidence and keen intuition The culture of their Deep Kingdom values family ritual and fine craftsmanship Shield dwarves survived a long fall from grace surrendering many of their ancient kingdoms in wars with goblins and Orcs These losses have lead to a cynical mindset yet shield dwarves will endure anything to restore their ancestral homelands Duergar are dwarves whose ancestors were transformed by centuries living in the deepest places of the Underdark That chthonic realm is saturated with strange magical energy and over generations early duergar absorbed traces of it They were further altered when mind flayers and other Aberrations invaded and performed horrific experiments on them Fueled by Underdark magic those experiments left early duergar with psionic powers which have been passed down to their descendants In time they liberated themselves from their aberrant tyrants and forged a new life for themselves in the Underdark and beyond Racial Features Base Racial Speed Elven Weapon Training Darkvision and Fey Ancestry

Features Base Racial Speed Civil Militia Darkvision and Fey Ancestry Subraces A touch of the Feywild remains in half elves with this bloodline and even those untrained in magic possess a hint of wild power Like their wood elf parent these half elves have a quickened stride and eye for stealth Yet many break away from isolation in Faerün s forests to explore the rest of the Realms Most half drow result from liaisons between Seldarine drow and surfacers While half drow inherit a few magical gifts they aren t usually raised in the Underdark Racial Features Base Racial Speed Darkvision Relentless Endurance Menacing Savage Attacks Intimidation Proficiency Creatures of intense emotion half orcs are more inclined to act than contemplate whether the rage burning their bodies compels

make them natural survivors Subraces Bound to Nessus the deepest layer of the Hells these tieflings inherit the ability to wield fire and darkness from the archdevil Asmodeus infernal bloodline Descended from the archdevil Mephistopheles these tieflings are gifted with a particular affinity for arcane magic Tieflings from Zariel s bloodline are empowered with martial strength and can channel searing flame to punish their enemies If you are having trouble picking your race use this table to compare the racial attributes available in BG3 Sub races have minor changes that you may also want to consider as you work on your Build Click the table header to sort Black Dragonborn Blue Dragonborn Brass Dragonborn Bronze Dragonborn Copper Dragonborn Gold Dragonborn Green Dragonborn Red Dragonborn Silver Dragonborn White Dragonborn Lolth Sworn Drow and Seldarine Drow Gold Dwarf and Shield Dwarf High Half Elf Wood Half Elf and Drow Half Elf Lightfoot Halfling and Strongheart Halfling There is no overall Best Race in Baldur s Gate 3 but players will find that certain Races and Subraces will have advantages when it comes to certain events and playstyles Dwarves for example would be naturally inclined to tankier and melee builds as they come with bonus Dwarven Resilience and Proficiencies to Battleaxe Handaxe Hammer and Lighthammer It is important to note that not all choices made in Baldur s Gate 3 are done for battle or build purposes however so players should feel free to pick the race that they prefer for roleplay aesthetics or optimization objectives The full launch of Baldur s Gate 3 will feature a total of 11 races and a total of 31 subraces to choose from Each of these subraces will offer a variety of traits for your character that can alter their Base Speed move distance per turn capacity to see in the dark Cantrip availability of Spells and more Subraces are variations of a group with notable distinctions in appearance and characteristics Subraces feature additional lore and in some cases intrinsic alignments that may impact your relationship with other races during the course of the game Subraces can also help players by giving their characters a direction through traits The traits of each of the subraces are unique to another and can suit a certain This is part of the world of D D and you can explore what effect your race has by checking out Backgrounds and tags When choosing your Race and Subrace some factors to look at such as the different dialogues and the element of role playing but the most important component is the Racial Features First it s important to mention that in the full release of Baldur s Gate 3 Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access have now been removed giving the player complete freedom to choose the race they want that better correlates with the selected Class Moving forward these Ability Score Points instead are now associated with the class players will choose Take the time to read the description for each Race and Subrace you ll select to better understand its Racial Features For example some races such as Elves or Gnomes have Darkvision allowing the character to see clearly in dark areas This a very useful feature for new players as you will tread multiple locations and most likely fight enemies in the dark Another factor to consider when it comes to Racial Features is movement speed and in Baldur s Gate 3 some races are capable of moving farther than others in combat An example would be choosing a race with great movement speed if you are playing a class that excels in melee combat this way you can reach and attack your targets easily without wasting a turn Racial Proficiencies are another factor to consider when choosing your Race in Baldur s Gate 3 A good example is for some players who choose to play as a spellcasting class like Sorcerer Wizard or Warlock but they want to be able to wield melee weapons such as Shortswords or Longswords Selecting races such as the Githyanki provides proficiency in wielding the said weapons making your character proficient in using spells and melee weapons Races and Subraces provide a selection of traits and racial features including proficiencies base speeds night vision and more Race choice in Baldur s Gate 3 will also make a difference in your dialogue options NPC interactions treatment and race unique scenes These are some of the things that players would want to consider during character creation if they are going for a specific playstyle In Baldur s Gate 3 there are some races that are non playable or available in Character Creation You ll encounter these other races as you explore and we would like to indicate them below In Baldur s Gate 3 dialogues and interactions play a pivotal role in enhancing the immersive storytelling experience As you journey through the richly world your chosen Race influences how characters perceive and respond to you offering a diverse range of dialogues and role playing opportunities When engaging with NPCs your character s Race often sparks unique conversations NPCs may react differently based on your race expressing curiosity prejudice or camaraderie These interactions can provide valuable insights into the lore of the world and the dynamics between different races Furthermore your Race can open doors to specific quests interactions and even alternative solutions For instance an Elf might have a deeper understanding of nature allowing for unique dialogue options with animals or druidic characters A Dwarf s familiarity with craftsmanship might grant insights into intricate puzzles or forge alliances with skilled artisans The racial background also comes into play during conversations within your party Companions may share personal anecdotes opinions or concerns related to your race adding depth to their character development and encouraging meaningful interactions Choosing a Race that aligns with your role playing preferences can lead to more immersive and satisfying interactions If you enjoy delving into the lore consider how your race s history beliefs and cultural background shape your interactions with the world and its inhabitants So orc gets a free revive and better crits The rest get cantrips and some extra proficiencies 0 0 I don t get the whole races and sub races thing Aren t all non humans sub races They are HUMANoids after all 1 14 Will Shadovar be added in the future 0 0 I will wait until the Grung are added I ll die on that hill probably because they won t be added 4 0 They made Zariel Tiefling the most viable paladin and also Pact of the Blade Warlock tbh you can get Darkvision Fire Resistance all intimitadion checks with advantadge and 2 more powerful smites Don t get me wrong I like those features but they made every other race Paladin to be two steps behind this one This makes me thing about all the races and how unbalanced they are sometimes Half Elf and Drow with nice features BUT they also scale at level 3 and 5 with two good situational abilities Since I don t got Elf I can t say if they scale but their base is a pretty good standard usefull but not op Which leads me to the following point Halfing s luck is BUGGED and never works and Humans are trash Wtf is that shitty perk of allowing them to get more carry capacity Hell just give them an extra feat AND if you don t want people to abuse the 2 Stat feat something I feel horribly bad since most people will just skip feats and add extra stat you can just put a rule where that feat can not be chosen when you create a human Or you can just delete the 2 stat feat and simply allow the 1 2 every 4 levels OhAnd what about the dragonborn is it a bug or the breath attack doesn t go up at 6 and 11 like DnD 5e does So yeah I think they should reconsider mending the halfling s luck and give some love to humans Tieflings at this moment shine in every CHA class and outclass outrace every other one 8 5 D D Humans are the most versatile race and can be anything That s why their starting bonuses are less specialized and more customizable than the other races No matter what class you want to play human is always an effective pick Larian Humans are stupid and boring in our personal opinion which should absolutely affect our players choices If you pick one you get one petty little skill like most other races get the COOL and AWESOME Githyanki get up to 5 btw and you also get some equipment proficiencies that are like maybe useable if you re specifically a sorcerer or wizard or something not that the benefits of another race or a single level in cleric wouldn t outweigh that Also you get extra carry capacity so you can right click items and press send to camp slightly less often lmfao enjoy that one idiot human pickers In every fantasy roleplaying game especially single player games humans are the top choice for players People like to self insert or at least strongly relate to their character With the recent player data Larian has released we can see that Human and Half Elf are neck and neck for the most picked race But the only reason so many people are picking Half Elf is because they wanted to be a human but didn t want to be handicapped for it If we have to wait until the first PAID DLC for an option that makes humans not objectively suck then I m going to be pretty disappointed It s not like picking a human in their current state makes the game unwinnable or anything it s just a totally unnecessary spit in the face to the majority of players for no reason whatsoever 14 28 No love for Aasimar huh 15 0 bro let me play a kobold or goblin i want to be a small chaotic when playing with friends 28 2 why not Dhampir 6 8 WhatsApp would be the best race for both wizard and sorcerer because I m not sure which one I ll play and I might switch class but one can t switch race 0 0 I cannot play as a skeleton 15 6 Please add Aasimar Firbolg Triton and all Genasis 19 15 Man they really made picking Human a worthless choice You get proficiency with some weapons and armor that you would have gotten anyways if you d picked a class that would actually use them You get one bonus skill and a little extra carry capacity No darkvision no innate spells no special abilities no bonuses to anything It s like they actively DO NOT WANT you to pick a human Give them their damn bonus feat 43 9 Why did they get rid of racial ability score bonuses Totally dumb 21 113 Though it doesn t say so anywhere other than looking at the skills the wood elf and wood half elf still get the free stealth skill proficiency too as well as the speed boost from fleet of foot 9 0 Hope the Tabaxi Goliath Warforged and Genasi eventually 28 4 I will give them any amount of money to add Shadar Kai 14 6 Why is there no half giant Would have love to recreate Grog Strongjaw from Vox Machina 13 33 Here s hoping for Tabaxi and Goliath to be added eventually 40 8 No Genasi Bruh 10 18 I wish there was a genital slider option 33 33 Why dose the Half Orc look like Prince 4 0 Need Aasimar first of all 55 5 why is there no lizard theyre so cute and im not a furry 17 16 I hope they add kitsune race 14 88 Pah No dragonborns Lizardfolk Anything that isn t just human remixes Won t be purchasing this game 24 124 So many cool races in the PHB and they had to focus on 7 elf subraces This is going in the grudge book 34 20 would like Bugbear tho 15 5 Where Lizardfolk 39 8 Where is Half Orc 39 5 Honestly I already know that my characters race won t be added but damn I wish they would add changelings in the future Changelings are simply so cool 24 8 where are dragonborn or halfdragons 26 5 Hopefully they ll put in Aasimar in BG3 then I ll get it hands down 33 5 Fingers crossed for goblin even if it s a DLC Or kobold but goblin seems more realistic though not likely still But considering the popularity of goblins in general I hope they make it in there somewhere 34 2 half orc till I die played in BG one and two I always play half orc 27 2 Laughed my ass off you You so pathetic really No one cares about your whining Game will sell a lot it already are If they didn t add any beast races no one will cry about it except you Get a life You can ask but they decide put time on that or not Modders will maybe do this later but you will get nothing like unic dialogues or scenes for this race you will play as nothing with this So suit yourself 15 148 this list is so barren 13 4 To everyone who keep s saying they have already stated they personally will only add the races introduced in the PHB officially however let us all be real everyone the modding community for this game will be crazy give it time and mods for races will start popping up So you will have to wait but im looking forward to seeing the mods that come out 20 1 This list sucks it s all just variants of humans if this was the list of races in DND I d never play 26 44 I m really into the Feywild and love playing as Fey Eladrin Fairy and Harengon I would love to see one of them in this game But I know it s 0 to none for those races to be introduced in this game But I sure can dream of what ifs at least 10 2 I d kill for lizardfolk tbh I just want to wander around eating people s fingers mang 26 0 I have to admit that I have been waiting for dragonborn but with each new class or race they add I start a new game and enjoy playing the same game all over again with the new option I would like to see the character items that are empty so far make an appearance like belts robes and other equipment 4 0 Chad Half orc worship equals inferiority complex irl 7 0 Well Barbarian was finally added Too bad Half Orcs still don t exist Guess I ll just have to wait another year and a half 6 3 will assimars be added to the game 3 0 furries and scalies on suicide watch 36 10 So I know I ll get flack for this But I hope that Larian doesn t create different Subraces for the Dragonborn when they re implemented I now the new sourcebook coming out gives them 3 but I genuinely think that the options are already suffering a bit of bloat with all the options we have now and the likelihood of the Half Orc and Gnome getting in as well It s just too much I d rather they just take all the strengths of the Dragonborn racial abilities and make them mono race Just leave the scale colors to the usual character creation shaders don t make Chromatic and Metallic and sure even Gem their own things 6 37 Larian isn t going to make these ridiculous monster races playable You re not going to get to play Tiamat okay I m sure they ll eventually make gnomes and half orcs and yeah I think the duergar subrace and svirfneblin subrace would be appropriate for the setting but don t expect a half tarrasque demilich as an option 17 26 Half Orcs Dwarves Dragonborn LET S GO 12 0 Welp guys we disappointed by your boring race choices There are 5 humans with different constitution plus one grey skinned human 16 6 No big body races Where s the Half Orcs Orcs Goliath Firbolg Come on guys 17 6 This page notes the wrong speed for Half Woodelves They are faster than base speed 2 0 I find the whole 4th 5th edition something abominous In 3rd edition you had the choice play and keep it simple with the 3 core books If you wated more options you could buy more books with the added options Personally i like to make my character my own not one of 3 options 2 23 If Larian doesn t add the exact race that I want than I am going to cry Seven races every sub race is NOT ENOUGH I don t care if half orcs gnomes and dragonborn are supposed to be added in the future I want my race AND I WANT NOW By the way I hope everyone can pick up on my sarcasm 38 17 Please add Leonin and Dragonborn 15 2 You include an obscure race like Githyanki but not Dragonborn or Half Orcs 43 15 I like to see anthropomorphic races like Dragonborn s Tabaxi s Loxodon s Leonin Locathah Tortle Aarakocra s Lizardfolk Kenku s Kobold s and Minotaur s 66 9 I would love to see Warforged be added to the game they re my favourite DnD exotic race 9 8 I really hope they just add more monstrous races the races they have now are pretty cool but boring for people that like to play more exotic races That being said i d like to see Dragonborn Orc s etc added instead of all the half version of some races 19 1 Kobolds would make my day Heres hoping Even if they re a dlc 29 4 Good thing there s no animal races but there s literally everything else animal races are weird af I like how you can make literal half breeds for each different type of elf 7 55 Laughing my ass off at all the scalies shitting their pants in anger because they can t play a lizard like in Divinity OS 2 10 53 To all the people complaining about missing monster races do you really think the game would be better if almost every obscure race was added to the Baldurs Gate 3 One of the coolest things about the game currently is how NPCs react differently to different races If you add more races then every separate race will not be focused on very much The entire game would have to become more streamlined No studio is capable of devoting time to both fully fleshed branching paths for each distinct race while also adding dozens of race options If you want minotaurs aasimar tabaxi etc to be added to the game then just wait for a mod to come out 23 31 I really would like to see races like kobold dragonborn asimar gnome orc half orc goblin kenku tabaxi and bugbear to add a vast variety of playstyles through the game but I wouldnt say goliath cause I think they may be too big for the games scaling unless they would fix that in the future and I wonder if multiclassing will eventually be a thing since I would personally love to make a rouge fighter 13 4 Look at what is below myself Oh god the furries have come 6 22 https www geeknative com 103964 the most popular dd races in dd beyond in 2020 The fact that humans are the most played race is a bit depressing to me but not entirely unexpected That being said Dragonborn must be included A full fledge D amp D universe without them is just poorly planned Other popular races I m sure many people would love to play as would be Tabaxi goliath aasimar and a few other classics I would suggest Aarokocra but I could understand that a flying race such as that may be a bit game breaking 10 15 Larian if you see this please make the half orcs look as fat and ugly as possible 8 15 Drow should be a subrace of Elves it should not be it s own race 16 11 Firbolg Triton Tabaxi Aasimar and Genasis please 17 6 Tabaxi Dragonborn and Yuan ti please Though I m definitely gonna try Druid class first regardless Climbing skill and poison immunity is super awesome While my computer can play it I m hoping the game will be as long as it ll take to download 150GB Cue the sweating man meme 28 5 remove hobbits elves and humans add trolls orcs and illithid as playable races and the game will be a winner 12 58 Dont know why they didnt add mostly finished races and classes like Goblin Bugbear and Paladin for example If we have to wait 3 months there should be more meat 5 8 I m not buying until you add Dragonborn 41 12 omg with these lame ass half races 10 21 Kobolds as DLC id pay for it plus the people that don t want kobolds in there game don t have to get it I think that s a good grey area 23 2 Knowing the mod community if they are like it was in BG2 and NWN they will be added 2 0 Will Gnomes Dragonborns and Hal Orcs be added in full release Was really looking forward to playing a Gnome 14 1 hopes for half orc 23 0 I just kinda hope they add the Swashbuckler Rogue subclass though I m gonna be giving thief a good try in mean time 2 1 I Would love if they had the option to play a Kobold 36 3 Patch 3 Lloth Sworn Drow get Fairie Fire cantrip at level 3 1 1 Wood elf rangers the new 35 feet movement coupled with the high wisdom and dexterity 1 0 still no half orc and dragonborn from the phb5E 27 2 For Video Game Gamers you lot are quite unreasonable it s like this is the first video game based on D amp D if you want to help so much petition Larion for a Mod ing tool and make them your selves then send Larion the end result that way you can get more races in shorter amount of time and get them to do all your wishes OR just wait for the game to release and for modders to add every race under the sun and more You should worry more about the game not running as intended then not having 50 shades of Elf 25 7 Honestly the lack of core races is concerning No Gnomes No Dragon Born yet we have drow i dunno i feel like this is really lacking meanwhile Wrath of the Righteous is adding like i dunno like 3 5 new classes and a couple new races on top of everything else and a new turn based system I have to say the fact you didn t add a 2 int race leaves wizards kind of in a bad spot Especially if you arent adding dice rolling stat generation system since the point buy is really restrictive and relies on that 2 bonus Basically yes we need more race options if only adding all the core races 15 15 where is my kobold 17 5 I can not wait to play Dragonborn with how much explosive stuff that is around breath weapon into a room and you explode half the map I guess fireball could do the same but no I wanna sneeze to destroy my enemies and loot 14 1 Well you can tell us it s in early access all you want but that s not going to stop people from voicing their opinions on what they think would make a great addition to the game If people want beast races then Larian Studio s team should consider it If no one spoke up on the matter then no one would care would they Larian Studios has not stated anything on other races yet so that is why I am speaking up and hoping they will bring something other than just gnomes halflings and half orcs to the table which I presume they already plan on bringing in to BG3 at the moment I want to speak for a lot of the people here and hopefully Larian Studios will shed some light on the subject if they have any upcoming plans on bestial races if any at all Personally I hope they bring lizardfolk or minotaurs as a playable race I ll be the first in line with wallet in hand when they announce something other than a human or sub human whether it be a year from now or five I can wait 44 11 message to everyone who complained about x race not being in the game Its is early access dummy 7 9 There is no Aasimar to balance the Tiefling 14 4 So only humans with different sizes It s 2020 and we still have no minotaurs goblins or centaurs as playable races in RPG 10 17 No Gnolls or Kobolds Y Y There are so many different human faced races but I don t want to be a human Please Baldurs Gate team please let us be a beast for once D amp D has excellent beast races 32 8 Drow don t get Keen Senses anymore That s racist 4 1 I want a tabaxi 6 3 I was hoping for a half orc and Goliath 46 3 Duergar pls 5 1 Real talk been watching a few playthroughs we need a playable Goblinoid race 21 4 Zariel Tieflings just there waiting for Paladins to hit the shelf lol 7 0 i would like to make a argument for dragonborn and goliath so that barbarian players have the classes they like to use barbarian with 17 5 What if Warforged 9 3 Search Results BG3 Races and Subraces Comprehensive Guide Baldur s Gate 3

ambushing their targets Bugbears are sensitive to sunlight medium in size but have a bulky build they are also capable of seeing in the dark making them a dangerous race to encounter Gnolls Gnolls are hyena like humanoid creatures who excel in scavenging and stacking odds in their favor for successful hunting No battle tactic is off limits to a gnoll pack and to face one is to know unbridled carnage Goblins Goblins are considered the most adaptable and resourceful humanoid races in the world you can find them almost anywhere and where they are weak they make up for in terms of being cunning intelligent beings and cooperating with their group A single Goblin can pose no threat but they can be a force to reckon with if you are outnumbered Hobgoblins Unlike Goblins Hobgoblins are large that have orange and reddish skin They are also cunning and resourceful but they are much stronger as they value strength and martial expertise above anything else Hobgoblins are skilled combatants who are capable as well of seeing their targets in the dark Kuo Toa Monstrous fishlike humanoids that are short pale and covered in slimy scales They have been driven underground by humans and their ilk who ve become crafty individuals filled with madness They are swift creatures who use the dark to their advantage to prey on their victims Mind Flayer Also known as Illithids and referred to as Ghaik by the Githyanki wields psionic abilities and uses telepathy to communicate They are feared by most creatures across many worlds as they abduct life beings to control them and ultimately mutate them as their own Mind Flayers are lethal beings since they consume their victims by extracting and devouring their brains Ogres As descendants of giants these tall beings are usually seen with features of large torsos muscular arms bulky heads and disproportionate limbs Ogres are fierce and chaotic in nature within their tribes while some are generally solitary or join a civilized society if they are depicted as small and weak ogres Redcaps They are the most evil type of Fey you ll ever likely meet Redcaps are lethal as they are known to be psychotic killers who enjoy killing and inflicting pain Even though they are small these blood lust creatures have formidable strength that they use to hunt down their prey Anonymous20 Aug 2023 23 20 So orc gets a free revive

get Darkvision Fire Resistance all intimitadion checks with advantadge and 2 more powerful smites Don t get me wrong I like those features but they made every other race Paladin to be two steps behind this one This makes me thing about all the races and how unbalanced they are sometimes Half Elf and Drow with nice features BUT they also scale at level 3 and 5 with two good situational abilities Since I don t got Elf I can t say if they scale but their base is a pretty good standard usefull but not op Which leads me to the following point Halfing s luck is BUGGED and never works and Humans are trash Wtf is that shitty perk of allowing them to get more carry capacity Hell just give them an extra feat AND if you don t want people to abuse the 2 Stat feat something I feel horribly bad since most people will just skip feats and add extra stat you can just put a rule where that feat can not be chosen when you create a human Or you can just delete the 2 stat feat and simply allow the 1 2 every 4 levels OhAnd what about the dragonborn is it a bug or the breath attack doesn t go up at 6 and 11 like DnD 5e does So yeah I think they should reconsider mending the halfling s luck and

slightly less often lmfao enjoy that one idiot human pickers In every fantasy roleplaying game especially single player games humans are the top choice for players People like to self insert or at least strongly relate to their character With the recent player data Larian has released we can see that Human and Half Elf are neck and neck for the most picked race But the only reason so many people are picking Half Elf is because they wanted to be a human but didn t want to be handicapped for it If we have to wait until the first PAID DLC for an option that makes humans not objectively

implemented I now the new sourcebook coming out gives them 3 but I genuinely think that the options are already suffering a bit of bloat with all the options we have now and the likelihood of the Half Orc and Gnome getting in as well It s just too much I d rather they just take all the strengths of the Dragonborn racial abilities and make them mono race Just leave the scale colors to the usual

Bound by a pact to an all powerful patron warlocks trade their loyalty for supernatural abilities and unique magic The Fiend The Great Old One Archfey Wizards master the arcane by specialising in individual schools of magic combining ancient spells with modern research Abjuration School Conjuration School Divination School Enchantment School Evocation School Necromancy School Illusion School Transmutation School Picking the right class for your play style is an essential part of Character Creation Certain Races may have a better affinity to specific Classes and Subclasses for example Additionally you may want to opt for unique schools of magic based on Role Play or simple preference If you re going to optimize your character and party check out our Builds section Each Class in Baldur s Gate 3 comes with unique interactions because of their special abilities and personalities An example developers gave of these unique interactions will be the Druid s ability to interact with animals and engage in dialogue which other classes will not be able to experience This means that the game will interact with your character and introduce different features and storylines depending on your choices as early as Character Creation This could open up new unique quests dialogues interactions combat animations and experiences based on your chosen Class as well as your chosen Background and Race Larian has confirmed that characters will be capped at level 12 in the official release unlocking Planar Allies Otto s Irresistible Dance and Chain Lightning Upon the official release of Baldur s Gate 3 players will be able to see all 12 Classes which expands to about 46 Subclasses during Character Creation On average one class will have about 3 subclasses but other specific Classes may have more to try out such as the Cleric and the Wizard Baldur s Gate 3 also introduces the Multiclassing feature that will be available at release It s not really required but if you want to maximize your party s composition you would want to balance it between the different types of classes You don t have to worry about choosing the right class for your character when it comes to party composition as all Companions can be respecced to any other class So you actually have the freedom of choosing your preferred class without worrying about whether it would synergize well with your companions Do note that respeccing your companion s class will not affect them in any way in terms of story origin or lore For example if you have Wyll as a companion and you decided to respecc and change him into a different class he will still be a Warlock story wise Upon the official release of Baldur s Gate 3 players will be able to see all 12 Classes which expands to about 46 Subclasses during Character Creation On average one class will have about 3 subclasses but other specific Classes may have more to try out such as the Cleric and the Wizard Baldur s Gate 3 also introduces the Multiclassing feature that will be available on release Subclasses are specializations of a class Players can opt for different branching paths and continue to benefit from the features of the initial class while also gaining unique abilities for their Subclass So a Rogue for example will have to opt to become a Thief or Arcane Trickster at level 3 From that point onward the character will receive all the benefits of the Rogue class plus the special benefits of their Subclass of choice Keep in mind that during character creation not all subclasses are unlocked for players to initially choose as most of these subclasses require a certain level in order to select the branching path of your class As for some classes that allow you to choose a subclass during Character Creation you can always check its description and the initial features that you gain In Baldur s Gate 3 you will be able to Respec your characters as many times as you want as long as you have the required gold and have already added Withers to the Camp Approach him and select Respec among the services he provides Withers will ask for 100 gold pieces for his service The price of the service DOES NOT increase during the course of the game nor if you use it frequently Any character can interact with Withers to Respec even your Companions if they pay the asking price Note that respecing a character does not change its interactions or Quests When choosing a Spellcasting class such as Sorcerer Warlock and Wizard you are given the option to select your Cantrips and Spells By default they have recommended cantrips and spells but you can always change the initial magic that is equipped by your character For new players we highly recommend just following the default spells unless you re someone who is familiar with 5e As you progress in most cases you can always change your Spells later on according to your preference Multiclassing is a feature that will be implemented upon the full release of Baldur s Gate 3 This is the ability to switch to another Class or Character and can be done in game In order to allow all your wildest dream class combinations Larian removed Ability Score Prerequisites So there s no more need to get your Charisma up to a pesky 13 if you decide to make a soul pact with a playful Archfey or dangerous Fiend You can Multiclass into anything your roleplay and build desires demand In short this means warriors will be able to wield arcane spells rogues can master divine magic spellcasters may dabble in martial prowess and you ll have the freedom to build the exact class that you want While Multiclassing can be powerful it may also spread your character s ability thin so it s best that you plan and prepare ahead when you consider multiclassing Whether you are an experimenter at heart who forges class hybrids through careful consideration or you just can t decide between a warrior and a mage in Baldur s Gate 3 it s possible to test your wildest builds Multiclassing really changes the game literally because it allows you to fully customize the theme of your character It has both a roleplay and a practical function leading to all sorts of chaotic combinations and experimentations Unlike standard DND 5e rules Larian has removed the Ability Score Prerequisites You can Multiclass into anything your roleplay and build desires demand In short this means warriors will be able to wield arcane spells rogues can master divine magic spellcasters may dabble in martial prowess and you ll have the freedom to build the exact class that you want For each level you can choose a different class to spend points on and begin building a bespoke Multiclass character Given the possible combinations it s recommended experienced D D players fully leverage this feature But if you decide to evenly spread all your points into every class for no strategic reason there s naturally an achievement for that too Note Baldur s Gate 3 has a level cap of 12 Multiclassing means you won t get the full effect and abilities of a specific class Multiclassing will divide your character s experience between different classes it s is essential that you focus on some of the key abilities of the class you want to utilize Be mindful of level distribution and keep in mind that your abilities will be determined by the levels you invest in each class It s best to consider level distribution to ensure you gain some essential abilities at reasonable intervals In Baldur s Gate 3 a multiclassing character can choose all his her class specific responses For example a monk rogue can choose monk response or rogue response By Multiclassing it is easier to test and create the character you dream of without the need of starting a new game and creating a new character Multiclassing is easily possible as long as you meet the requirements As mentioned Multiclass becomes available as soon as you acquire a class level For example as early as reaching Level 2 Warlock you will have the option to continue leveling up in your class or to delve into another in the level up menu By doing so keep in mind that as soon as you decide to Multiclass your Character level will never be the same as your Class level An example of this is if you are a Level 3 Warlock and decide to Multiclass into a Level 1 Bard your Character level will be Level 4 The reason why we mention that it is important to consider looking at your character level is that some aspects such as an increase in proficiency bonuses correlate with it While on the other hand by reviewing your class levels you ll be able to determine what class features are unlocked With that being said we do want to advise you that when Multiclassing there are some limitations to it First we want to point out that you are free to Multiclass to any class you want going back to limitations an example would be if you start off with a Wizard and multi class to a Sorcerer it doesn t mean your spells slots will be doubled or in some cases actions such as an extra attack will not stack So make sure that you always consider the different factors when it comes to Multiclassing in Baldur s Gate 3 There are a lot of possibilities for creating unique characters that the Multiclassing feature offers so don t be afraid to experiment discover and try out different combinations when considering multiclassing Don t forget to have fun and enjoy the process of discovering new playstyles and character concepts that would make your character unique in its own way For beginners diving into the world of Baldur s Gate 3 some classes offer a smoother learning curve and versatile gameplay Here are a few classes that are often considered among the best for beginners Fighter The Fighter class is straightforward and well suited for newcomers They excel in combat have a high hit point pool and can wear heavy armor Fighters can focus on melee or ranged combat offering flexibility in playstyle Rogue Rogues are agile and excel in stealth and ranged attacks Their abilities make them excellent for both sneaky approaches and dealing substantial damage from a distance They can also disarm traps which can be particularly useful for beginners navigating the game s challenges Cleric Clerics are versatile spellcasters who can heal buff allies and deal damage to enemies They wear medium armor and can use a variety of weapons making them adaptable in various situations Warlock Warlocks have a unique spellcasting mechanic and access to powerful spells Their spell slots recharge on short rests which can be more forgiving for beginners who may not be familiar with the longer rest mechanics of other spellcasting classes Wizard While spellcasting can be complex the Wizard class provides a wide range of magical options Their spellbook system allows for spell customization and they can specialize in different schools of magic to suit different playstyles Ranger Rangers are skilled in both ranged and melee combat and they have a connection to nature that offers unique abilities They can summon animals to aid them in battle which can be helpful for beginners seeking additional support Why so many dislikes People are disliking comments randomly wtf is going on 23 118 So it looks like they were able to integrate all the standard options for Subclasses Would have loved if they included classes from Tasha s Cauldron I currently have a Soulknife Rogue Abberant Mind Sorcerer I would love to recreate in BG3 22 17 BOOM KABOOM KABUL 7 32 Are any one of these classes a Dark Knight class or similar 11 38 will there be necromancer 13 38 All you need is Fighter or Barbarian You can brute force your way through the game without wasting time on all that nerd magic nonsense 44 93 Looks like the most popular class will be Bard 7 29 zin aan 6 10 3 12 How can i be a furry warlock 16 77 The Twitch channel Critical Role has me very excited to play this video game It will be very difficult for me to decide on a single class to play I m thinking cleric wizard fighter paladin or sorcerer Thoughts 26 58 People begging for classes like the devs come here lol 45 6 I know Artificer is a Eberron class but cmon PLEASE give us Artificer 47 27 And what about the Psionic classes Given the start of the game he thought they would be a logical choice 17 48 No monk until the full game is out Once again the monk is the forgotten step child of the D D world 29 7 They patched in Lathander Mielikki Talos and Tymora now so they can be added to the Deities page Odd they didn t bring in Beshaba with Tymora usually the two exist in balance so it s strange to have one without the other 9 3 Hope they add gloom stalker for the ranger 10 5 So no kensai made it to Baldur s Gate 3 huh 10 9 class idea s Storm herald Path of zeal Barbarian Hex blade Warlock Samurai Fighter War Domain Cleric Divine soul Shadow Sorcerer 20 34 I wish that they could add dragonborn race I d then create my DnD character in game xD 12 13 If i make a sorcerer with a high charisma to be my team speaker do I have to have them up the front all the time or is there a designated team representative option Alternatively if i want to play a low charisma toon like maybe a Barbarian as my front tank can I choose a NPC with highest charisma to be a team representative 17 11 What idiot made that ranking list 11 67 Hoping for a divine soul sorcerer D 10 6 This game is like a wet dream I just recently purchased early access and I m stunned by the feel and role playing elements and there is soooo much still to come I really hope there can be dlc for some of the expansions too I know it s a lot of work but I m sure it ll come around eventually 7 5 I can t wait to have a Variant Human Twilight Domain Cleric Level 1 and Lore Bard Level 19 Character will have 1 Eyes of Night for 300 ft darkvision 2 Heavy Armor Proficiency 3 Martial Weapon Proficiency 4 Fearie Fire and Sleep spells 3 Cantrips 5 One Extra Feat 6 One extra skill proficiency 7 1 to two ability scores After multi classing with Bard my character will be covering nearly everything Party face tank caster weapon user skill monkey 9 19 People the devs are not here to cater to your every whim Based on the comments many of you act like it s super easy to just toss an entirely new class or subclass or race into the game They are trying to focus on things that will appeal to the most people To expect them to put your psionic kobold or centaur artificer or goblin twilight cleric into the game just because you want to play it is unreasonable 65 12 Artificer is completely not mentioned Is this going to be the one class left out 6 23 NEEDS MORE EVIL OPTIONS I mean where the Antipaladin Oathbreaker at What about the Death domain Cleric I also hope the Necromancer mage wont be straight up garbage like the pen and paper version 9 23 If they dont put in Bladesinger I will just Uninstall and not pay for any DLC 11 95 I hope they get the Kensei Monk in and Kobolds as a playable race 9 7 idk if the devs will read this but everyone is making requests for classes on this wiki and I just want to say that while I think it goes without saying we all want our favorite subclasses added whats most important is making sure they focus on QUALITY over QUANTITY i would like if they polish the subclasses they have and not try to spread themselves too thin trying to appease EVERYONE usually appeases NO ONE However this game is looking like it is set to be one of the greatest games ever made If they continue it and it keeps making money expect to see subclasses added as DLC options and probably one shot modules too I can foresee this becoming the definitive DnD game which could have years of dlc release as long as people continue to buy the DLC and show its worth the time to create the dlc 65 10 I m excited to try a dual wielding hand crossbow Fighter Rogue It sounds bananas Here s a level 6 version of the character I made on DNDBeyond to those wondering if I ve lost my marbles Phttps www dndbeyond com profile Vaesive characters 28607008 7 7 If they would just include Astral Self subclass for monk I d buy Because Ora 3 18 Why are all the classes either acting high voiced men or snotty hard ass women I am a woman gamer age 67 and I would like a deep voiced handsome male as a companion Are all the devs men who hate women And now the new class Druid is a woman I m not and do not want a romance with another woman What is wrong with you people I ve quit playing the game as I am disgusted with the companions 24 136 any idea why no shaman 3 27 I can t wait to try out my idea of druid barbarian multiclass Literally never die D 5 6 I need play with barbarian elf lt 3 2 3 i wanna be able to create a multiclassed abomination 11 5 is xanathar maybe coming as a dlc 3 11 Please Thief Swashbuckler 6 8 Forge Cleric when 5 6 So what about the blood hunter 5 46 I really want to be able to play a hexblade warclock That or a divine soul sorcerer Those are probably my two favorite classes 35 5 Does anyone know if there planning to realease more classes for early access Or is this all we got until the full release 6 3 Please please please give me path of the zealot for barbarian 7 3 I want to play half orc barbarian so bad 22 3 Add lvl5 for the Early Access 16 2 I want to be a goblin berserker and I want to be punted and thrown at my enemies 17 6 I really want Artificer 38 12 I really wish they d consider adding psionicist as an option when the full version is relapsed 6 27 It d be cool to see some Critical Roll content like Blood Hunter Artificer in game but i highly doubt it d be added 12 29 really wish sorcerer was available esp divine origin 11 2 Dang they gave the worst class its two worst subclasses Feels bad Hopefully they balanced Ranger 5 11 I would like to see a bladesinger wizard subclass or at least a war magic wizard subclass 18 4 still want psions I mean you have mibdflayers in game probably the most lore friendly class I could think of I dont care if 5e doesn t have them ive been waiting for psionic classes in a dnd bbased game forever Its a videogame things aren t going to follow the 5e system exactly anyway pretty sure Larian could develop a psionics system 5 22 If u guys look at your lvl up screen it says lvl 2 ranger or something similar so it will probably be in the game 0 5 I hope they add Scout rogue 6 4 Warlocks are kind of boring with only one short rest per long rest That is just not enoughEven wizards with arcane recovery get their spell slots back once a day I understand the limit but it should be AT LEAST twice per long rest or even three times 27 10 What about multiclassing 5 2 wait theyre NOT going to have a bladesinger 1 9 It says that rangers can learn thieves can t but rogues don t have that apart from that I dont know how they are going to implement it in a game 1 1 The lack of multi classing makes for very stale gameplay Want to make a monk paladin to replicate my sapphire knight custom class 2 30 I hope they add the option to short rest more than once 6 1 So I do hope they eventually after the release decide to add everything else WotC has added I would say the same about spells and cantripsHaving an Eldritch knight and not being able to booming blade is kinda ugh xD 5 3 I wonder if they will add Shield as an available spell for Eldritch Knights along with being able to select Blur as one of his any spell options The other night I had my DM go geeze after asking what my AC was 27 thanks to Shield with Blur active as a lvl9 1 4 Multi Classing Needs To Happen 52 3 God I hate 5e It s the most limiting system to date and has so many damn problems when it comes to actual gameplay 22 183 So we have Githyanki but not Githzerai the Illithid and the obvious psionic abilities they possess and yet no hint of a Psionic character Perhaps it will come in time One can only hope 8 7 Not many folks watched the update videos prior to Early Access hey Devs said that at this time their primary focus is to get all the classes and races from the Players Handbook into the game I wouldn t expect anything from Xanathar s Guide to Everything to even be looked as a future option until after official game release That s up to a year away anything they add to the game from other sources after that I would expect another year at the earliest and that is if they even do it Maybe in a future game expansion If so I would speculate they will stay within the Forgotten Realms Faerun Don t expect anything from Ebberon Wildemount Critical Role or otherwise You can hope and wish all you like but don t get your hopes up 34 4 Hexblade doe 37 6 I hope we get all the expanded options from Xanathar s Guide and even the Blood Hunter Blood Cleric and Gunslinger stuff from CR 10 15 Divine Soul is a very popular subclass for the Sorcerer class I sincerely hope to see it in the finished product 13 2 Biggest sin is no Expertise for Rogue How can you expect me to be evil if I cant roll in the thirties to steal from babies or hide after burning down the puppy shelter 24 1 No more prestige classes and multiclassing and full customisation Wont be able to make my samurai here then XD used to be Ranger Dervish Frienzy berserker theif acrobat that made a Hiten Mitsurugi master fast movement dish good damage and got the mobilityOr my ninja wich was phantom ninja shadow dancer theif acrobatSniff sniffI ll have to find another way hmmmm 3 18 where is Knight for fighter 6 1 It seems like a linear progression and no multiclass available with the current version of the game I hope that changes it feels like a very simplified version of DnD 5e The pathfinder kingmaker character progression seems closer to the standard dnd game model I am not saying this one is bad or anything but it s just about preference and i like the multiclass option and free pathing then the simplified BG 3 version It seems like the current version of the game lacks a bit of free progression by that i mean if you are a new player to dnd and lets say you only played Divinity serios as rpgs an almost no other CRPG you can sitll build a powerfull char without knowing much of the rule set but in most other DnD games you can rly make shity chars if you dont know what you are doing I guess its a bit stream lined i rly hope that changes but who knows still very early not even 24h since EA released so i am hopeful and i still have trust for Larian i loved divinity series 5 3 I hope you make warlock pact of the chain s utility as powerful as it is in 5e The ability to communicate over infinite distances steal objects spy infiltrate use items ect Without that pact of the chain is not very useful 0 0 i wanna barbarian fight mage dual class 3 4 I ll wait for my sorlock to ruin the combat 2 0 do we know if Bladesinger will eventually be added 2 2 I m extremely excited for the Druid to be eventually added 9 1 I hope they eventually get all the classes and subclasses for ultimate shenanigans Tempest Cleric Swashbuckler Echo Knight Divination Wiz Eloquence Bard Conquest Paladin Hexblade Divin Soul Sorc they re missing some of the best subclasses for each class Overall pretty happy with their list however 9 0 Lookin like I ll be recreating my eldritch knight for early access Can t wait until all the classes and multiclassing become available need me some barbarian paladin multi in my life 0 0 Hope they add Hexblade after Early Access Like c mon Hexblade is the poster child of Warlocks 32 4 Aww where my Path of the Zealot Barbarian 5 1 I want my Forge Domain 8 1 After reading through the comments everyone should keep in mind that early access will be released first Meaning an un polished game So they will be adding things tot he game till they feel comfortable with a full release tittle instead of early access 5 1 Ok so do is doing the tables for the classes Because according to the Warlock s Class page on this wiki they don t get their 3rd Level Spell slots until Lv11 and never get 5th Level Spell slots But as far as I know the Warlock actually get 3rd Level Spell slots on Lv5 and 5th Level Spells on Lv9 So what s going on here 1 2 Creen que este la clase de kensai 3 8 Is it really just the PHB subclasses Would really love the old Paladin Hexblade Multiclass oh well Hopefully they add the other subclasses from other books even if it s as DLC 9 1 Wait there won t be subclass kits Dammit I love playing stalker 0 0 GIMME MY SWASHBUCKLER DAMMIT 20 6 hexblade 13 3 Reeeeeeee where is the necromancer class at 0 42 I hope they make this games world more replayable Pillars of Eternity 2 had so many different classes and options but because of how slow the game was for the first 10 or so hours it made replaying it a slog just my opinion though 1 0 O No bladesinger wizard 8 0 Seriously the game is about mindflayers the preminent psions of forgotten realms and once again through another dnd game we still dont get a psion class 4 15 Too bad the supplementary subclasses aren t in Kensei Monk is my favorite 1 0 Sorcerers barbarians bards and paladins aren t confirmed classes 3 13 Can you multiclass in baldurs gate 3 Also how does flying work and can you create a tiefling with wing or a Aarakocra And finally what about the subclasses that are not in the player handbook like for example hexblade will they be in the final game or are we going to have to wait for an expansion sorry for my bad english 3 4 Search Results BG3 Classes Complete Guide Baldur s Gate 3 Classes Quick

seems like a linear progression and no multiclass available with the current version of the game I hope that changes it feels like a very simplified version of DnD 5e The pathfinder kingmaker character progression seems closer to the standard dnd game model I am not saying this one is bad or anything but it s just about preference and i like the multiclass option and free pathing then the simplified BG 3 version It seems like the current version of the game lacks a bit of free progression by that i mean if you are a new player to dnd and lets say you only played Divinity serios as rpgs an almost no other CRPG you can sitll build a powerfull char without knowing much of the rule set but in most other DnD games you can rly make shity chars if you dont know what you are doing I guess

Companions in Baldur s Gate 3 are special NPCs that can be recruited to join the player s party and usually aid the player during combat and exploration Companions have their own set of stats abilities equipment lore and more which make them unique from one another Throughout the game players will meet possible NPCs that can be recruited as a companion who joins your party if certain conditions are met This page covers a list of all the companions that can be found in Baldur s Gate 3 Some companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen as Origins allowing players to play from their point of view but that feature is not available during Early Access All Companions including both Origins and Hirelings can be respecced in the game to any other class the only thing that can t be changed is Race and Sub race for 2 characters If a character like Wyll is changed into a different class the character will still be story wise a Warlock in their head so absolutely nothing is changed for their story origin or lore if they are respecced in any way to any other class in the game Astarion is a High Elf Rogue who has prowled the night as a vampire spawn for centuries serving a sadistic master until he was snatched away Now he can walk in the light but can he leave his wicked past behind A High Half Elf Trickster Domain Cleric and one of Shar s dark disciples Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power While wrestling with her faith and strange untamed magic Shadowheart has enemies on all sides and a long buried secret to uncover A Human Wizard Gale has one ambition to become the greatest wizard Faerun has ever known Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest counting down to an explosion that can level a city Gale is confident he ll overcome it but time is not on his side Lae zel is a consummate Fighter ferocious even by the standards of a Githyanki creche Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy Lae zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people if they do not execute her first A Human Warlock and Noble by birth Wyll made his name as the heroic Blade of Frontiers He keeps his pact with a devil well hidden and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal Karlach a Zariel Tiefling once committed terrible deeds in the thrall of a powerful Archdevil This Barbarian has an Infernal Machine for a heart that keeps her body burning red hot Newly freed from her master s grasp she seeks revenge on those who sold her to the devil Halsin the Wood Elf is a Silvanus faithful He is the First Druid of Emerald Grove Minthara is a Drow Paladin in the service of Lolth and the Absolute Minsc is a Human Ranger Jaehira the Druid is a High Half Elf Hirelings are NPC characters that can be hired to join your party and assist you on your adventure Although Hirelings are not as interactive as Origins or Companions they each feature a unique identity and backstory Once Withers has joined your Camp you may speak to him to recruit a Hireling for 100 gold There are 12 Hirelings on the roster available for recruitment one from each class You may have up to three Hirelings recruited to your party and Camp at a time Unlike Companions you may dismiss Hirelings from your service at any time Their level will be reverted to 1 and their inventory will be transferred to yours Not necessarily but you can use them to fill up your party or to replace any lost companion from your team You can also create a completely customized party with just Hirelings If a Companion should permanently leave your party you can replace them with Hirelings The possibilities are endless as you can even hire a combination of Hirelings with the same class You can have a party entirely made of Barbarians for example Hirelings also give you additional options beyond the characters available from the Origins roster and it also gives you full control of the strengths and weaknesses of the Classes in your party In Baldur s Gate 3 you can Respec your characters as many times as you want as long as you have the required gold and have already added Withers to the Camp Approach him and select Respec among the services he provides Withers will ask for 100 gold pieces for his service The price of the service DOES NOT increase Withers also is the person you need to talk to be able to access Hirelings Any character can interact with Withers to Respec even your Companions if they pay the asking price Note that respeccing a character does not change its dialogue interactions or Quests When you re about to recruit Hirelings you will be able to choose from a selection of 12 Hirelings with each one representing a different Class By recruiting Hirelings to your party you can tailor the group dynamic to focus on a specific class allowing you to create a customized composition that would synergize well with your preferred party build With that being said it is entirely possible for you to have a party made up of only Fighters for example You may respec them at any time to create a customized party I was not ready for this 1 2 You can also get Alfira as a bard companion Not sure how i triggered it by being rude to her but after a few nights she will join you at camp 3 18 They really dropped the ball with the companions in this game No gnome dwarf halfing or dragonborn It wouldn t be a big deal if we could still make a custom party like in the original games RIP my role playing experience I guess I ll just use the party the game allows me to 9 57 Its funny how game inexplicity tells you how to best experience this game and that you should build your main char as a bard which is the only missing class among all companions 3 18 No orc to chuck people off buildings for me 6 2 i m a bit annoyed that you can t recruit any gobbo s from what i can tell the best you can do is intimidate them into video game submission which is effectively just a passive role 4 9 you can turn that brain thingy from the first level into a companion 7 2 I kinda wish the male companions had more race variety we have 3 human and 2 elfWhen the game has 11 races there should be a little more variety for the male characters 52 4 I think we need alignment table for all companion 8 9 I know Fextra makes these wikis so they can get ad money and viewbot their streams but holy sh t i wish they actually put some info into em 71 7 this comment section makes me wanna commit suicide right after i finished the game 8 17 i dont mind the companions we have and i quite like all of them moreso than other games of this genre but one thing that baffles me is the complete lack of a dragonborn origin companion or hireling its no big deal but its wild the complete lack of one entire race 21 8 A bit of lackluster that you don t get any medium small size companion No gnome no halfling no dwarf but furthermore you get 3 human and 3 half elf BUT no drow no half orc or dragonborn Oh well at least a dwarf would have been nice 42 14 Are there ways to get all companions and be friends with them at the same playthrough without anyone leaving 10 0 The comments here are absolutely hilarious They all consist of rando saying something objective about the game some idiot objecting to the comment with their opinion being stated as fact You can t even respond to responses so it s just a bunch of people saying thing nuh uh It s like kindergarten up in here how dare you have an opinion of your own that doesn t match mine 18 14 As a DND player I appreciate that all of the Origin companions all have backstories that imply they are very powerful but they all start at level 1 or whatever level you are when you recruit them and aren t very strong This actually gets brought up by your companions and it is somewhat explained that they each lost some of their power due to the events of the nautiloid 7 4 you can get Alfira apparently I just got her to show up at my camp begging to join our merry little band 17 3 I m just waiting for a mod that enables in game character customization at any time I m pretty sure Divinity Original Sin 2 had a mirror you could use 11 0 If anyone finds a whinier comment section on a wiki I would love know This wins so far 32 14 Seriously was it THAT hard to add a few more companions one of at least every race or class they could just be more simple characters we don t need them to have a super intricate storyline just help them in a couple of quests or something and they tag along to the party also those could be a little more generic in a sense of not feeling guilt for changing their storyline class This is lame af 11 81 Two druids No monk bard or sorcerer Overwhelmingly elf half elf and human with no gnomes orcs halflings or dragonborn in sight Most of the starting companions are some shade of evil and disapprove of you doing general good aligned adventurer things It pains me to say but this lineup disappoints me The fact that there s not at least 1 companion per class is insane to me Respeccing and hirelings make for decent bandages but the problem is obviously deeper than their fixes If you want anything plot or flavor related regarding monks sorcerers or bards you are obligated to take the initiative with your one single custom character and you couldn t even have all three without paying to make your other companions something they re not It s lame 53 51 Only 10 companions That s weak BG1 and 2 had like 20 each not even counting the temporaries I know I know it s not the same cost and development time blah blah blah Still I thought this was the biggest game ever made or some 21 56 All I wanted was an Orc companion or a Dwarf companion 22 3 Ma question est la suivante concernant les mercenaires j aimerais en ajouter mais seule la classe m intéresse puis je refaire le mercenaire sur mesure Race skills etc Exemple j aimerais ajouter une barde a mon groupe mais Withers me propose qu un personnage gnome dégueulasse comme barde comment je peux changer le skin du perso Merci 4 8 RIP ALFIRA THE REAL ONES KNOW 28 3 Can Ellyka be recruited She just ran off then later died 3 0 Got to be the most boring lineup of cardboard people ever made I m sorry I talked trash about Lidya she was a better character than any of these edgy dolts she s sworn to carry my burdens 39 211 Really wish they would just add a hireling that was like the dark urge origin but without the dark urge RP stuff that could be recruited multiple times maybe someone who knows how will make a mod 6 46 volo the bard can be recruited to 14 22 No Dwarf Companion THEY HAVE WRONGED US 108 6 The only companions I need are Shadowheart Minthara and Jaheira The rest can off Btw is it possible to romance all of them at the same time 42 101 I found a new companion She s a strong powerful and brave trans woman who smashes the patriarchy 69 180 So they really gave us two druids huh That s a choice 43 4 lmao such turbo nerds here you can respec the companions to any class within the first 2 hours of the game people complaining about woke trash are such snowflakes lol 75 87 Lol there are so many Larian Shills here that can t accept any kind of Criticism This Herd Mentality is why the Videogame Industry has gone straight to when it comes to Quality 61 353 They really could learn a thing or two from WOTR companions So uninspiring with all the human and elf companions Most as white as cheesecake 37 229 Ok Karlach as a damn barbarian makes absolutely no sense when you consider her background especially WHY Minsc should have always been the barbarian and Karlach either a ranger rogue or fighter type 27 173 I speak for everyone when I say Shadowheart is best girl 86 66 1700 endings 0 orcs 0 halflings 0 gnomes 0 dwarves 0 dragonborns for companions You ve got to be kidding me 112 25 Cowards will never let me romance a goblin 170 8 About four years ago I got acquainted with isometrics From the classic three Baldurs Gate became for me the golden mean between the dialog Planescape and the combat Icewind dale But I am still sad about the finale of the offspring of Baal his subsequent canonization In my opinion the coin that fell on the edge at his birth indicated freedom of choice from the beginning of history to the end It was possible not to engage in fanservice with Minsk and Jaheira and come up with a separate story or at least move the ending from the last part I m sorry for my whining It s just that I think Baalspawn deserved to be a little better than the faceless final boss of a board game 26 41 Having just played WOTR these companions are pretty uninspired 51 142 Worth remembering it s still in early access I think the characters especially the origin characters are wonderfully acted animated and fleshed out They all have tons of personality interesting backstories and I think that s what matters in a DnD game Some find them abrasive and I get that But go outside if you want friends Also I think the point is to see their journey Will they stop being hostile and become a team Will they fall into disarray That s the point We ve barley seen the first act And again these will not be the only options in the game for companions 25 13 What the hell is this It s literally 4 humans and 4 elves not a single dwarf halfling or gnome Not even a half orc How the hell did they manage to be this boring 122 67 No dwarf companions 76 4 What an interesting an informative comment section It fills me with joy to see how gamers never changed 136 15 Why can t be have some so called stereotyped companions A dwarf warrior an elven ranger romanceable presentable males females and more importantly much more variety 54 112 Seeing as how they re bringing back Minsk and Jaheira I don t understand why they haven t returned other famous Baldur s Gate companions like Viconia Edwin or Sarevok It would have been AWESOME to see them again in glorious high res 3D and learn more of their stories And don t tell me their stories are finished it s nonsense if there s a will there s a way R A Salvatore brought back Drizz t s entire original party centuries after their deaths and even resurrected his dead father for closure In fact BG3 should have continued entirely with the original cast e g with the Protagonist being robbed of his divinity by the vengeful Cyric and cast down to begin again as a mortal storyline hinted at the end of TOB but never followed up 29 95 and i thought pathfinder wotr companions were terrible so far everyone in bg3 is obnoxious and unlikable 62 166 Feels like comments are mostly kids who saw a big streamer played this for 5 minutes and still have mommy cut the crust off pb j 115 40 First of all I believe that there s gonna be companions on every classes Second thing is I clearly do not understand why most people find current companions interesting I literally having great fun when Laezel and Shadowheart arguing They have some background like shadowheart is a last member of a cult Laezel got kicked out by its own race Astarion is Astarion Gale has a f king bomb in his chest They all are unique and dont forget that this game is still in early access I am not defending all critisim here but I feel like people expecting Matt Mercer level storytelling here 28 27 I want to play as goblin goblin companion soooo bad 30 12 Minsc is confirmed as is Jaheira 10 1 I would love to see relationship levels between personal characters That you can disagree or approve what they choose in dialoge if you are watching your friends choose dialog instead of it showing what we would want to choose because it influences peoples choice 26 3 Due to the big difference in how you can specialise characters compared to another Larian game such as Divinity It would only seem to make sense if they at least gave the option for a companion of each class Doesn t necesarily have to be easy to get them Getting Nettie or another druid from the grove as a companion to save Halsin and then making your actions change or confrim their reasons for wanting to stay with you or leave 9 1 they should make abdirak a companion 10 3 I kinda hate everyone in this game 80 48 All these companions seem lame and too special rather than authentic characters 46 64 I killed Lae zel 58 13 I feel like the game needs more good baseline companions and more interesting wacky companions Feel like all the companions hit an awkward niche where they aren t completely basic but also not too wacky Just this kinda boring inbetween with no real substance like they wanted to go out of the norm with them but got too scared midway through 35 26 The Companion Guide video for Gale is missing The video there is a Custom Character Guide instead 7 1 I see the mentalist as the first companion 6 1 Pahtfinder Wrath has better companions than this game 41 66 Where is the beautiful and evil female companions Viconia please Lae is ugly and unlikeable and Shadowwhatever is bland and uninteresting the males I hardly care as I wont be recruiting them anyway The lack of quality female companions in this game is astonishing 49 153 Gale guide leads to character creation on youtube 3 0 I feel like the companions here get a bad rap And not just by the weirdo who disqualified his owned opinion by starting his comment with NEEDS MORE BANGABLE SLUТS In game their fine nothing amazing but they re well written well animated and well acted enough to at least be like Ok we re stuck on this adventure together and I don t want you to die 38 15 I am hoping like the other Baldur s gate games they will have a vast array of companions and give you quite a few options for romance Baldur s Gate usually has a lot of different companions and the fact this one gives you a camp for them to hang at and switch out at it makes a large cast even easier Sure it will cost more money having voice actors for each character and the design of them but it is worth it for a true DND game You should have a lot of options even in your companions 25 1 I m not very happy with the companions so far I m dealing with it as it is but I hope for better companions on the road to Baldur s Gate in future chapters There is none with whom I could imagine a romance for my character Only two females limits the choices for a male player character anyway Lae is ugly and I feel no sympathy for her Shadowheart isn t very attractive for a half elf and looks rather mediocre Additionaly she s difficult to manage and doesn t really fit into my playstyle being a human fighter mystic knight subclass with noble background so that he isn t just a brutish warrior but can also be eloquent convince people and has got some knowledge But I m usually not avoiding fights against monsters f e in blighted village talking with goblins and avoiding a fight makes no sense for me in a DD game Shadowheart gets on my nerves with her secret mongering and non confrontional ways I know being a priestress of Shar and such maybe even unwillingly but still I don t warm up to her I really hope for better companions in the future 33 84 I just hope we get more companions down the road when we reach Baldurs Gate noninfected ones Not to say these guys are bad I love the fact you can tell them to piss off or downright kill them both through action and inaction but then you are left without options in your company build By the time full release rolls out I hope we get more options I know alignments aren t really a thing in BG3 save the reactions from your companions so having at least 3 options to choose from every class would be grand Not that your standing with them has any real impact on the game right now you can even romance whoever you want but constantly seeing my companions disagree with my choices because I m roleplaying a certain character is annoying Good Neutral and Evil is enough we don t have to go into Lawful Neutral True Chaotic because I can t even imagine how much work would go into the nuances of programming and writting Wishful thinking 12 3 I think Astarion is a good comic relief Maybe add someone lighthearted and extremely chill Think big Hawaiian dude chilling at the beach 5 12 Where is Minsc 24 4 Who greenlit the get your of the game self insert Gale I would slap a fanfic author for writing that 9 19 For those that were curious about the weird stat distributions like I was looking at each companion s stat distribution racial bonuses it would seem they are using the standard array for stats which means they will always have a distribution of 15 14 13 12 10 and 8 just with racial bonuses added and positions swapped around 6 0 What about US I cant find it after the ship crashed my little intelect devourer is out there roaming the wilderness all alone I must find it 41 4 Halsin join you if you save the grove 4 0 These female companions are godawful is there any reason that one has the face of a ugly pig and the other looks weak and meh can we have some strong independent female companions that at least look like a woman 38 127 for now gale is the only companion i can enjoy the others are just asking for poles up their asses lol 29 14 My father started the game with a Wood Elf Rouge named Zarah I can t find any mention of her on this wiki the Reddit or the Larian forums I can submit screenshots and video if admins want to see more 7 5 I m Fairly Certain our Ranger Companion will be Karlach the Female Tiefling that you have a quest with South of the Tollhouse She carries a Crossbow she has a tadpole that isn t turning her and expresses interest in joining you if you ask her to accompany you She seems like an obvious fit since she would give us the missing ranger companion a 3rd female to ballance the choices as well as another exotic race companion 13 1 I love that it s Early Access and everyone is complaining over the companions they gave us when they said they gave us the least likely ones we d use because they wanna see how we treat them xD 28 9 I kinda want companions for like we had in divinity original sin 2 where you just had to go to Sergeant Zrilla to get some companions that won t judge you for everything that comes out of your mouth 15 23 we need Minsc and Boo back 51 15 Really bunch of pretty cuties Need more stupid thugs freaky junky wizards and mad gnomes 39 10 A Mind Flyer companion a conqueror type evil companion will be nice Please 7 3 There should definetely be more companions and more interesting ones in the final release 18 5 Sit at a real DnD table and these companions don t seem near as edgy as most people s PCs Circumstances often choose your party more than preferences 22 7 Honestly I was surprised ShadowHeart was a cleric I swore she had more of a rogue personality However I kinda like her Gale is snobby like the rest of them I left Lae zel in her cage I mean after you help her get off the ship you would think she would be less nasty considering it was her inside a cage and not You So I said okay she can rot lol 16 4 Are these all of the main companions we will see I m just wondering as the Devs seemed to be complaining about our lack of interesting choices in character creation yet there aren t any Drow Tiefling halfling or even dwarven companions it is said that mercenaries will exist however that doesn t lead me to believe they will be interesting characters in there own right however that assumption could be completely wrong 12 5 Guys Hells what I ve discovered I started another playthrough and got 7 approvals of Astarion and 4 nights at the Camp so far and A DIALOGUE with him that I never had at my first playthrough I wonder if I am alone in this The dialogue is very flirty in fact Astarion shows up that he has fallen in love with you It starts when he talks about stars being especially bright tonight and after no spoilers So why I am shocked I didn t see a single dream yet I don t know that he s a vampire and anything about his background but somehow I got this scene If it can help anyone that s what I did for approvals 1 Deceived Tieflings and asked Lae zel to say please to free her from the cage2 Killed Gimblebok amp gang near the ruins3 Said Ethel about Tadpole in my head4 Kicked the squirrel in the Druid Grove5 Let Arka kill Sazza 1 and then said Astarion that refugees are desperate 1 6 Chose decapitation in the Camp dialogue with him night 2 Suppose maybe the approval rate and the story point you are matter to get this dialogue 5 2 7 What a bunch of wingy whiner babies Based on the events these are you companions deal with it get over your selves 19 54 I m not in love with any of them All are serviceable but D OS2 seems to have a much better lineup of companions Gale is the only one I m actually into for now 14 16 gale and wyll is the best so far 6 4 So apparently we are only getting one more perma companion No word if it s Male or female 1 6 Hate the companions They seem all pulled directly from the 90s The Vampire the Evil Cleric The Badass Female The Loner The Crazy Wizard Where are the heroes Where are the good guys Why don t we have the option to build a good aligned party 34 32 I hate that the only slightly less human looking companion is an obnoxious gith would ve liked a bit more unique companions 26 15 I really wish they hadn t put 2 Human mages in our party Kinda bland and redundant 9 18 I really think we need another female companion soo everything will be balanced Like all things should be 9 28 level 2 chapter 1 its just too early to be making choices for companions 3 0 PPl really been missing that big fing sign at the beginning saying early acces You really thought you were going to get the full game this early More are coming 12 2 Wyll and Shadowheart need a serious stat rework Shadowheart should at least be DEX focused over strength so she can sneak around as a trickery cleric Wyll just need to have a neat 14 or 16 in DEX and he s fine so far he s not too bad with Mage Armour and False Life though 9 8 Search Results

are lost they can be replaced with Hirelings Hire any combination of Hirelings including a Hireling party of all the same Class This gives you additional options beyond the characters available from the Origins roster and gives you full control of the strengths and Classes in your party to create a customized party Build If you prefer to you can even have a full party of Hirelings Each Hireling comes with a preset name visual and Race these Hirelings cannot be further customized except for their Class Each Hireling is a preset character When recruiting Hirelings you will be able to choose from a roster of 12 one from each of the Classes Filling your party up with Hirelings allows players to customize their party dynamic so they can be filled with one type of class So it is possible to have a party entirely made of up Barbarians or a party of Fighters for example Gold Dwarf Barbarian Eldra Luthrinn slayer of people monsters and cups of sweet pear tea was shown a watery grave when hunting Absolutists in the valleys of the Chionthar Lightfoot Halfling Bard Brinna Brightsong s bawdy crooning was silenced by an Absolute bloodbutcher after a controversial performance in a Triel tavern on High Elf Cleric Selûne Zenith once an optimistic Evereskan Graycloak journeyed to Faerûn in search of a new sunrise An Absolute warband proved his dour fatther right Zenith was doomed Mephistopheles Tiefling Druid Danton was a refined druid and rearer of peacoks until he thought transforming into one would help him escape Absolutist mauraders He was wrong Wood Half Elf Fighter Once a battle worn veteran fighting for the Absolute Varanna learnt that loyalty to the would be god did not protect you from the murderous whims of jealous generals Githyanki Monk Sina zith s monastic preferences marked her a misfit among her kin as did the illithid tadpole an Absolutist forced in her mind For this the githyanki slew her as an aberration Half Orc Paladin Kerz lived many years as a paladin and mercenary years which took a hard toll on them befriending a group of pleasant ogres they laid down their weapon and taught a rudimentary etiquette class before the ogres were attacked one night and Kerz once more took up their steel Lolth Sworn Drow Ranger Ver yll spent his twilights scribbling odes to leafy canopies bushels and the merits of the noble hedgehog When he refused to join the Absolute its forces tore his forest and body apart Human Rogue Maddala s blindness was cured by another True Soul passing through her village so they could watch it being burnt to the ground around them Such was the price of refusing the Absolute Dragonborn description Duergar Warlock Kree s penchant for killing folk with a mere whisper was prized in the Absolute s ranks but the utter devotion to her patron was met with lethal disapproval Rock Gnome Wizard Sir Fuzzalump was much mocked amongst his playful kind for his dour demeanour and single minded devotion to the magical investigation of cave moss He claims not to have giggled in over a decade and has never frolicked wish we had full customization for this lot I ve always wanted an army of midgets tried doing it IRL but apparently child soldiers are frowned upon for some reason 0 0 Additional Crazed Hireling suggestion At level 10 you can cycle through and respec each hireling to a cleric to allow it a one time use Divine Intervention This can be used to get multiple Devoted Maces Divine bounties with loads of potions and supplies to help blast through the endgame Costs a fair bit of gold to respec dismiss each hireline but is well worth it This also allows you to save Divine Intervention on your party s actual Cleric for an encounter where you may want the full recharge or perhaps the big damage blast great thing to save for endgame boss fights 1 0 Since lost Companions cannot be brought back once they are lost they can be replaced with Hirelings They absolutely CAN be brought back The Revivify spell and scroll exist and DO work on them even if they were not a part of your party 3 9 For those looking to get maximum usage out of your hirelings here is your Crazed suggestion Brinna Brightson Zenith Feur Zel and Danton I respec Brinna to change her stats skills immediately but the other two can be left basically factory The goal and role of these hirelings which IMO should be acquired as quickly as possible is as follows Brinna will take role of dedicated group thief and geared as such As Hafling she gets her Hafling Lucky trait which mitigates a 1 roll When combined with advantage either through gloves of thievery cat s grace her ability to steal entire inventories is incredible Early game acquisition of Smuggler Ring allows for really easy start since you can no risk repeat loot the Druid s grove send her back to camp while your adventuring party does it s thing without having taken the attitude shift from Brinna since she operates independently Throughout entire game I used her to crack through all sorts of areas EASY since College of Lore bard is just as if not better than an actual Thief class IMO thanks to spellscaster access on par proficiency level If you really want to milk her you can set her up to be a performer to try and rake in some extra coin that way Lots of potential with Bard class that I didn t really explore in first playthrough Having Brinna in your group also allows you to take extra short rests since you can sub her out to use her Bard song to give some extra juice as you keep going through Zenith is meant to be your buffer spell slot preserver There are a number of very useful and beneficial cleric spells which last all day long but of course burn through those precious spell slots Danton is also a supporter in this role though his purpose has a secondary function which I ll get to in a bit The main spells I have Zenith casting on the group are the cantrip Light to provide melee characters with good visibility as well as later on the Daylight spell to enchant items Having Daylight in some of these ridiculously dark locations was honestly so helpful throughout the playthrough it was super handy Protection from Poison is another good spell to try and cast on as many party members as possible to mitigate that damage type from the game almost in it s entirety especially split between him and Danton Sometimes it s good to keep a few slots for Prayer of Healing since in certain situations you can teleport back to camp after a big fight swap out to use the Prayer to Heal up then put him back in camp I usually respec him to Life Cleric for this reason since you get a little extra heal that way If you want to get really fancy with him you can also respec him and turn him into a cleric tank to be able to permanent bond a character for the level 2 Warding Bond spell He will still take damage can die at camp but if he s generally stronger than the character he s buffing he doesn t die too often Danton the Druid is meant to take Circle of the Land and he is meant to help flush out the druidic side of the equation For starters he can cast the ritual spell Longstrider on the entire team at no cost to his spell points This will give everyone additional movement and you don t need to keep it slotted in any of your characters to keep the benefit of the spell since it lasts all day Many of the spells I use with Danton overlap with Zenith but the main reason I use Danton second is because all excess spell slots as well as natural recovery charges get converted into goodberries Once you ve reached high enough level and depending on how much you want to use him for this purpose you never need to worry about camp supplies again By taking him early game being able to offset your camp supplies with goodberries lets you focus your attention on picking up things that actually matter Generally at the start of a new day I will round up the team in a camp location and do the respective character swap buffs etc Once everyone is ready to go I do the adventuring for the day using Brinna to offset the load by providing those additional short rests via bard song She will also help keep your thief kit levels high since you can also opt to send locked chests back to camp and have her use the spell Knock there instead of burning kits You ll want as many kits as you can keep your hands on for when you reach act 3 as the DCs start to get significantly higher at that point and you need many more of them too Shhh WAY more locked goodies to try and get into I trust my shady Bard Brinna to git r dun I cannot understate Brinna s veratility as a heist operator and in first playthrough I had her avoid combat pretty well entirely She let me unlock so much content so easily I was honestly shaking my head Having Zenith and Danton as backup just made everything else so bloody simple Shadowheart could dedicate her spell slots to fewer support role spells which really helped make a lot of combat enounters a lot simpler in itself Not needing to worry about camp supplies from the get go was also a great boon Since you re doing the morning ritual it generally just ends with the goodberry swap and you leave Danton behind and pick up your 4th before heading out Sometimes you ll be munching on those berries along the way It s really really handy Basically for 500 gold since I do 2x Respecs for the Bard Cleric Danton I keep stock you get SUPERB level thief that can easily recoup your upstart cost as well as provide extra longevity to the team Side note If you choose to either ignore not encounter Astarion or potentially get rid of him for roleplaying purposes then I d say having Brinna is even more essential for the group dynamic She ll be at camp most of the time But maybe after you ve cleared the threats out of the dungeon is a good time for her to run through and unlock find everything for you Having as many Light cantrips available is also very very very good Between my Light cantrips and sunlight enchantments I honestly don t know how much hassle I dodged in act 2 as a result of having just literally good vision alone These dungeons can get DARK and being able to properly see the environment helps a boatload My character s darkvision is no substitute for an actual light source when it comes to be noticing details in the environment Really helps spot traps and whatnot without needing to rely so hard on character perception checks Hope this has been helpful To sum up I love the hireling respec Withers system I managed to get some GREAT use out of it and I hope you guys do too 14 3 why aren t we allowed to make 4 characters of the same race 16 1 Backgrounds Sir Fuzz SageVer yll CriminalMaddala UrchinSina zith OutlanderKree CharlatanEldra

they were fully customizable in regards to race and name and everything Would allow drop in out multiplayer Could save 12 of your friends characters as hirelings that they could then join your game and you could recruit to your team for them to play as each time 38 0 and the hireling in Fafners spot near as I can tell is Jacelyn High Half Elf Wild Magic Sorcerer 2 1 Not sure why this information isn t available in game before recruiting them unless I m missing it but here are the backgrounds of each hireling along with the proficiencies granted Since their classes and abilities can be changed

you want your hireling to be then it will be randomly created That way we can at least choose what race and class combo they will have That way we can hire infinite hirelings and as per the achievement use them as cannon fodder doing a playthrough as a pacifist letting them do all the heavy lifting 8 1 Big question here can you change the sex race or body face features of these hirelings

on these ESL tips 3 2 The approval system is so similar to Dragon Age approval system 6 4 If you are a Cleric and select Shar as your deity you get extra dialog with Shadowheart as well as additional approval after discovering that she too is a follower of Shar via the Helm and statue of Selune near the Blighted Village 7 0 Astarion approves if you use deception in the dialogue with the bird near idol in the grove 0 1 astarion approves if you use persuasion in his dialogue after you kill laezel during the first dream sequence 0 1 If you swap characters before doing an action is the approval based on the character who takes the action or your player character 1 1 Lae zel approves of selling out Astarion to Gandrel Damn cold 0 0 There s one in Astarion s Approval Up thats wrong Make Novice Crusher kiss your foot is supposed to be Kiss his foot for now and then steal the ring off his foot not sure if stealing the ring part is what gives the approval or if just simply kissing it does After that when walking towards the Heavy Oaken Doors that leads to the Shattered Sanctum a yellow question mark will appear above his head you have to choose the last one answer in the dialog that says to enjoy the party and be careful of what blood he drinks 2 0 Is there any way to tell how much an Approval action is worth I ve noticed that if you pet Scratch over and over in camp the companion approval prompt will show in the corner each time but so far I haven t been able to tell if it is actually doing anything 2 0 ok so after testing these approvals are farmable and many others exist not listed here for instance since Shadowheart is the only cleric healer I have I want her around a lot in camp at a point after she admits to being a cleric of shar there s an option to ask her to tell you about herself beyond tadpoles etc she says she likes orchids and can t swin choose to ask her to spot orchids for you option 1 and she will approve exit all the way out and restart the conversation you can farm this until maxed approval unsure what that is but so far i ve seen neutral medium high very high exceptional 4 1 Search Results Companion Approval Guide Baldurs Gate 3 Wiki

3 present a lineup of various hostile characters in the game Enemies are presented in all shapes and sizes from creatures humanoids mythical beings and much more Even though each enemy is unique with its own behavior killing Enemies grants various drops that reward players with items they will need as they continue to progress through the game This page covers a list of all the enemies encountered in the game which includes their location attributes item drops and more on each individual page that is linked below Enemy AI is smarter than ever because Enemies employ more tactical strategies and they possess some features available to player characters For instance if Enemies are unarmed and they see a Weapon lying around nearby they ll grab it and attack you with it You can use this scenario to your advantage by disarming your target beforehand This pushes them into a situation where they ll need to utilize Action Points just to run towards and equip a Weapon in order to hit you Furthermore enemy AIs are able to use their resources more efficiently For example they ll carefully plan their next series of attacks so they can still have room to execute other actions like Dash or some Spells in the future They can even use Throw to heal their party members from a distance by hurling Healing Potions at them similar to how a player character would Of course these enhancements will be used by friendly NPCs as well I m having problems adding new enemies to this page I ve created pages for the Wood Woad Mephits and Spectator beholder but I can t seem to get new rows inserted

unique and powerful type of enemy Bosses are encountered throughout the game they have increased health a unique set of attacks its own behavior and stats Usually bosses are encountered at the end of a chapter of the main campaign or encountered in various locations or areas that require to be defeated in order to proceed further or to unlock more areas In this section players can find different guides and strategies on how to defeat a certain boss as well as information regarding its location statistics rewards lore and many more This page covers a list of all the bosses encountered in the game Given the nature of Baldur s Gate 3 many of the Bosses you encounter are optional and most of the time are determined by the path or decisions you have taken previously This means that Bosses like Minthara for example can be faced following certain path and can become an ally if you decide to take the complete opposite direction Is this wiki dead or what The game is super popular and yet no useful info whatsoever beyond the act one 23 1 BulletteIts fast its skin is invulnerable to blades attacks with surprise and downs several characters with a single blow It is in effect a stealthy dragon of death inclusing a breath attack Its not entirely unkillable but does require spreading out your characters so as to keep TPKs in a single round from occuring How to kill something like this It is arguably the single toughest opponent the early access offers But you can have help A good deal of help Like Glut the former myconoid king with meaty hits and speed spores And animated minotaurs and other such help With all that including psychic magic missiles 2 wizards can share it it will still require multiple lethal engagements As far as i can tell the only place the bullette stays and fights without merely killing half your party and running away is the graveyard Go ahead an animate the bullette too then animate all the hook horrors and wiping the myconoid town should be doable Besides going up against a myconoid sovereign a bullette and 3 hook hoorors and 2 minotaurs along with animated duergar isnt good for anyones health 5 0 Auntie EthelAt her weakest in her hut If you can deliver a hit that makes her afraid she will be practically defenceless Redcaps will show up if still alive but you can probarbly finish the battle in a few rounds anyway with 4 characters plus help pounding away before they show up Notably the redcaps do not follow into the fireplace Interestingly being scared keeps her from teleporting away or turning invisible and running away If you instead encounter her in her underground lair along with her mirror selfs a early magic missile with a single missile on each mirror image gets them to pop out along with their actions every round and the battle again is relatively easy If you dont care for her loot set up trade when she is friendly to see what she has push her into the central pit by eldritch blast mele attack or other Note the well outdoors It strengthens you but if you turn on her it weakens you When she is dead it again strengthens but causes a hangover As with all traders she can be milked of coin that otherwise vanishes before killing her by unloading all kinds of useless stuff like gems and taking the coin When she dies she carrioes those gems you traded to her 2 0 there is nothing here 8 0 Search Results Bosses

Members Page Manager Settings Create Wiki Back to top Merchants for Baldur s Gate 3 are various NPCs that players may find as the story progresses Players will be able to buy certain items and as well as trading a variety of goods and resources that have been gathered or are no longer needed for a certain amount of gold You can find detailed information on a merchant s location and more on each individual page linked below Many Merchants in Baldur s Gate 3 have a partially randomized selection of items on sale from their overall item pool This primarily applies to Scrolls Potions Food and Weapons with a 1 enhancement bonus Merchants will reset their inventory if the player either levels up the reset occurs when the player completes their level up rather than on receiving sufficient experience or if the player completes a Long Rest Resetting a Merchant s inventory will generate a new selection of items from their overall item pool as well as restocking any non randomized items the player has purchased Certain items generally those with unique names are not restocked upon either levelling up or completing a Long Rest Merchants will not buy or sell items at their listed value instead the prices offered by Merchants will vary based on both the currently selected character s Charisma and the Attitude of the Merchant towards the currently selected character By default with 10 Charisma and 0 Attitude Merchants will sell items to the player for 250 of their real value and buy items from the player for 40 of their real value These prices will be changed if the currently selected character has higher or lower Charisma or Attitude A Merchant s Attitude can be increased by completing a trade with them that is unbalanced in their favour You can also gift items and gold to the merchant without asking their items or gold in return The increase in attitude you get with the trade depends on the gold value the merchant profited and the character s level The higher the character s level the more gold you need to give to shift their attitude At 1st level each 4 gp in the merchan t favor increases their attitude by 1 The most optimized way to max out the merchant s attitude is to first pay 100 gp to reset the character to level 1 then gift 400 gp to the merchant as a level 1 characeter A Merchant s Attitude can be decreased by doing the opposite trying to complete a trade with them that is unbalanced in your favour This will initially have no effect but after you try for a third time will start to decrease their Attitude by 15 each time Note Each merchant has a different attitude level toward each character Only the Attitude and Persuasion of the character that initiated the trade is taken into consideration even if you change character in the trade interface The price at which a Merchant sells items to the player changes linearly based on both factors This information is shown in the following table The price at which a Merchant will buy items from a player also changes based on the selected character s Persuasion skill value that is Charisma modifier Proficiency Bonus if proficient and the Merchant s Attitude towards that character If the character s Persuasion skill and the merchant s Attitude toward the character are both zero the value the merchant pays on the item equals the item s base value divided by 3 Each point of Persuasion and each 20 points of Attitude reduce this divider by 0 1 Thus the formula is Merchant Buying Price Item Base Value 3 Persuasion 0 1 Attitude 0 005 Note The value is rounded to the closest whole number Mattis Collector of valuable items at Druid Grove Dammon A trader at Druid Grove Arron A Trader at Druid Grove Brem A Trader at ZHENTARIM HIDEOUT Grat The Trader A goblin trader at Goblin Camp Roah Moonglow A Halfling merchant at Shattered Sanctum Blurg A Trader at Underdark Myconid Colony A Drow Elf Blood Merchant at Moonrise Towers Act 3 Sticky Dondo A human child merchant at the Guildhall Long rest is not resetting Arron s shop for me Anyone else having this issue 0 0 Pretty sure persuasion factors in too because I ve had charters with less charisma but persuasion from a background get better prices Also stealing is so ridiculously easy I would never waste the time improving attitude A sleeping target won t even realize they ve been picked and thus won t look for you or call a guard even if you fail the dice roll sleep may agro a witness though Fog darkness will also prevent them from finding you and they ll give up before the spell wears off if you just sit in it If there are guards they will be called and search longer so invisibility works better because only the thief has to pass a charisma check innocent party members get a free pass if they get questioned but an invisible thief can t be questioned And if your thief is still being questioned after all this talk to them and send them back to camp as they won t even be questioned if they aren t actively in your party The base game characters give you all you need for this Astarion can steal with his rouge expertise and the guidance cantrip necklace from opposite the druid grove Shadowheart can cast cat s grace for advantage on dex based rolls at level 3 and Gale knows fog by default with invisibility as a level up option or learned from a scroll 2 0 The list for players selling items is wrong You can probably go up to 100 of the Item now as I get 50 just by having 5 Persuasion 66 with 5 and 100 attitude 52 with 6 and 0 attitude and 71 for 6 and 100 Attitude 0 0 PSA Stocks refresh after every long rest and every INDIVIDUAL level up 7 different characters leveling up one by one Means 7 refreshes 2 0 In multiplayer does the whole party share one cash stash Or do individual players have their own gold I see in players inventories they have separate gold amounts but does that mean each player has their own amount Or does it get pooled together 0 0 As of final patch of EA there s a bug that causes you to lose positive attitude on the traders If you choose to barter not with your main character but with Wyll for example bought attitude with traders will reset to 0 if you ask Wyll to stay in camp and then recruit him back to the squad again Be mindful of that if they don t fix it in release 2 1 FYI buying attitude isn t currently worth the investment unless you have a huge amount of items to sell For example if you have 3 charisma and a base attitude of 0 you d need to sell over 9000 gold worth of items base value to start seeing profit after investing anything into attitude 100 0 00167 0 5 9000 5 9000 100 15 about 3 gold profit after investing 1500 gold into attitude points to bring it up from 0 currently a 50 price modifier in this version to 100 66 666 price modifier and selling 9000 gold worth of items base price Due to the way the formula works it s a waste of gold to invest anything at all into attitude points unless you re going to sell and or buy items worth many thousands of gold 2 0 Auntie Ethel also sells things in the Druid Grove initially Not 100 sure when she leaves but I think it s when you see her being accosted in the wild 1 0 As of Patch 9 Aaron the Grove merchant requires 1500 gold to raise his attitude from 0 to 100 2 0 Besides charisma and attitude selling and buying prices also seem to be influenced by the type and amount of charisma based skills you have are proficient in or perhaps it s just the skill values patch 9 Example 1 At attitude 100 a 1 heavy crossbow can be bought by a 20 charisma warlock with 5 deception intimidation persuasion and 8 performance for a price of 1800 out of 1200 150 buying price 2 At attitude 100 the same 1 heavy crossbow is bought for 1440 1200 120 by a sorcerer with 20 charisma but 8 in deception intimidation persuasion and 5 in performance So apparently some or all of the skills further influence buying and selling prices There s also videos on youtube showing performance influences them but that was from an older patch 7 or 8 Furthermore the prices for maximum merchant attitude have increased dramatically with patch 9 Ranging from at least around 1000g up to 2300g was the highest i ve seen so far 1 0 when does volo sell stuff 3 0 how do you improve attetude 2 0 Brem the Zhentarim sells you some magic items but only if you help Zhentarim band with the quest Finding the missing shipment He offered me The Whispering Promise ring Volo offers the same ring in your camp Studded Leather Armour 1 And Longbow 1 Dagger 1 Greatsword 1 and Warpick 1 They might be ramdon The merchant

Members Page Manager Settings Create Wiki Back to top Lore for Baldur s Gate 3 covers the basic aspects of the world of D D that are touched on in the game Keep in mind that whilst BG3 is a sequel to BG 1 and BG2 not all concepts are visited and the world of D D is incredibly complex Yes The story takes place 100 years after the events in Baldur s Gate 2 and shortly after the events of Descent into Avernus We don t want to spoil anything about the story but it will be connected to the previous games in meaningful ways Baldur s Gate 3 takes place right after the events of Descent into Avernus The holy city of Elturel disappeared from the Forgotten Realms and descended into Avernus the first layer of the Nine Hells In our canon it was saved by a party of heroes The game is based on the 5th edition ruleset of D D and was created closely together with Wizards of the Coast The land of Faerûn is in turmoil Refugees cross the wilds fleeing the hell torn stronghold of Elturel A vicious cult marches across the Sword Coast uniting every race of monsters and men under the banner of a cryptic god they call the Absolute Chaos strikes at Faerûn s foundations and none may escape its talons Not even you The grotesque nautiloid ship appears out of nowhere blotting out the sun Its writhing tentacles snatch you from where you stand The mind flayers have come imprisoning you on their ship infecting you with their horrid parasite You will become one of them By fate or fortune you survive when the nautiloid crashes in the Sword Coast outlands You set out for civilization desperate for a cure for the parasite festering in your brain only to take center stage in a conspiracy that runs as deep as the Nine Hells New enemies await As for old foes the shadows stir And all roads lead to the legendary city of Baldur s Gate When you first begin Baldur s Gate 3 you will be treated to an intense cinematic depicting a Mindflayer and its ship and their assault on the city You will then see a group of Dragon Riders teleport into this space to attack the ship which triggers a chase scene across realms Those new to D D lore will be confused by the events so this is an executive summary of the critical points you must understand 1 Mindflayers reproduce by infecting other races with tadpoles after a certain time the creature will take control of the host and convert it into a Mindflayer They are also known for their great psionic power that allows them to control and enslave other creatures whose brains they consume 2 The Dragon Riders that appear are the Githyanki a tribe within a race that used to be enslaved by the Mindflayers After successfully emancipating themselves from the Mindflayer s mind control they set up in the Astral Plane and created a pact with deity Tiamat that a small group of Red Dragons would be their mounts The Githyanki despise and wish to annihilate all Mind Flayers A Vampire Spawn is a Medium undead neutral evil monster in DnD 5th edition Vampire spawns appeared as they did in life though their features were hardened and appeared predatory They lived their lives in darkness and believe they were better than other living or undead creatures Even though they did not possess all of the standard vampire powers they still had the affection of all their traditional weaknesses and vulnerabilities When it came to a life of adventuring vampire spawns would seek vengeance on their creators or penance for their new damnation If these monsters could overcome their ravenous emotions they might seek out knowledge glory or power Pride was the true driver of the vampire spawn since they believed themselves better than others Shar the Mistress of the Night was the goddess of darkness and the caverns of Faerûn as well as a neutral evil greater deity A counterpart to her twin Selûne she presided over caverns darkness dungeons forgetfulness loss night secrets and the Underdark Among her array of twisted powers was the ability to see everything that lay or happened in the dark Shar s symbol was a black disk with a deep purple border Shar was also the creator of the Shadow Weave which was a counterpart and attack upon the Weave controlled by Mystryl and her successors before both of the Weaves fell into ruin during the Spellplague According to one of the most ancient myths of the creation of the world and the heavens after the universe and its crystal sphere were created by Lord Ao there was naught but the primordial essence the protoplasmic raw stuff of existence Described as chaos and timeless nothingness the sphere was filled with no more than dim misty shadows neither light nor dark for such things had not yet separated All that moved here were the Shadevari the thirteen lords of shadow whose origin whether from elsewhere or from the shadow itself is unknown In time Shar coalesced from the primordial essence alongside her twin sister Selûne The goddesses were beautiful identical but polar opposites raven haired and silver haired one representing the dark the other the light in the manner of yin and yang Yet they were so close they saw themselves as one being known later as the Two Faced Goddess or the Sisters Who Were One They complimented each other and brought order out of the chaos Together they created from the cosmic ether Abeir Toril and the other heavenly bodies and infused these worlds with life In the process they formed the goddess Chauntea at that time the embodiment of all matter in Realmspace later only of the world of Abeir Toril whom they worked with to bless the worlds with life This universe was darkened by the hair and welcoming embrace of Shar and illuminated by the cool radiant face of Selûne However there was no fire or heat on any of these bodies Desiring to nurture life on the worlds that formed her body and limbs Chauntea asked the Two Faced Goddess for warmth Then for the first time Shar and Selûne were divided being of two minds on whether they should let there be more life on the worlds or not The two goddesses then fought over the fate of their creations From the residues of these struggles emerged the original deities of magic war disease murder death and others Seizing an advantage Selûne reached out of the universe altogether and into a plane of fire and though it burned her painfully brought forth a fragment of ever living flame She ignited a heavenly body the Sun in order to give warmth to Chauntea This greatly enraged Shar she renewed her assault on her injured sister and began to blot out all light and warmth in the universe or the lights of Selûne gravely weakening her To protect the early life Selûne tore out some of her own divine essence though it nearly killed her and hurled it at her sister Selûne s essence tore through Shar bonding with some of Shar s essence and pulling it loose This magical energy combined to form the goddess Mystryl the original goddess of magic Although Mystryl was composed of both light and dark magic she initially sided with Selûne her first mother giving her the upper hand Mystryl balanced the conflict and mediated an uneasy truce Shar was cast into her darkness for centuries enabling light and warmth to bathe Abeir Toril and the other worlds The battle left Selûne deeply wounded and thereafter her power would wax and wane with the ages though she would gain strength from alliances with her daughters and sons as well as interloper deities from other planes Meanwhile Shar who d retained much of her might once again grew strong and was aided by the shadevari Consumed with bitterness and loneliness she vowed revenge and lurked in the darkness until her time to strike The war between the sisters would go on forever more but life struggled and flourished on the worlds watched over by Chauntea Netheril was an ancient magocratic human empire of Faerûn whose influence was felt across the Realms for thousands of years The Netherese people lived in a strict hierarchy for hundreds of years split into the nobles of High Netheril living in flying enclaves miles above Toril and the commoners of Low Netheril settled in demesnes on the coast of the Narrow Sea During its glory years before Dale Reckoning the Empire of Magic would spread across a great stretch of Faerûn The empire was the pinnacle of human civilization during the first half of the Age of Humanity Although they had humble roots as mere fishermen and farmers the Netherese were introduced to the Art by the elves of Eaerlann and came to harness this arcane power in ways that would shape Toril for generations Over the next thousand years they discovered the long lost Nether Scrolls developed the creation and use of mythallars and created the first of their flying cities Xinlenal The arrogance of Netheril grew to the point where they attempted to attain the divinity of magic and wound up destroying the Weave In the resulting maelstrom the Faerûnian pantheon was altered and most of the flying cities of Netheril came crashing to the earth Avernus was the first layer of the Nine Hells of Baator The most likely beachhead for any attack by demon kind it was the primary battleground of the Blood War legions of devils marched across its plains in continual readiness to repel the hordes of demon invaders that sailed the River Styx into the layer The layer was a charred wasteland of vast ashen plains covered in rubble and the occasional line of foothills and basalt mountains heaped with broken rocks of obsidian and quartz The ubiquitous presence of rocks and boulders some of which seemed to resemble tormented faces and shapes of creatures rendered the terrain extremely treacherous and difficult to cross at any pace quicker than a fast walk Mind flayers also known as illithids meaning mind flayers or mind rulers in Undercommon and sometimes referred to as ghaik by the githyanki were evil and sadistic aberrations feared by sentient creatures on many worlds across the multiverse due to their powerful innate psionic abilities Dwellers of deep Underdark areas these alien humanoid looking beings sought to expand their dominion over all other creatures controlling their minds to use them as hopeless slaves and devouring their brains for sustenance Their natural psionic abilities also made mind flayers respected in the eyes of the drow beholders duergar and other dominant races of the Underdark The Blood War was an ancient conflict that raged between the fiends of the Lower planes The two main sides of the war were the demons inhabitants of the evil plane of chaos of the Abyss and devils representing the equally evil but lawful realm of the Nine Hells Neutral evil yugoloths played both sides against one another The Blood War had raged on since the Age Before Ages a dark time when the Prime Material Plane had not fully developed The conflict was massive spanning entire planes of reality and hosting an almost infinite number of fiends Devils were a lawful evil race of fiends who hailed from the Nine Hells of Baator They were vicious creatures who were capable of attacking and killing others for essentially no reason However they hated being the target of misery themselves This led to another trait of devils their extreme vindictiveness combined with a lack of ability to accept their mistakes Devils had an instinct to look for others to blame when they suffered setbacks and had the drive to exact vengeance against whomever they held responsible even when they were demoted to a weaker station For example the grandson or granddaughter of a dead being who was indirectly involved in the demotion of devil was an eligible target for the demoted devil even after it managed to be re promoted Demons were the most widespread type of fiends They were usually chaotic evil by nature and were native to the Abyss Demons had no true rulers though powerful demon lords and deities were able to gain enough power and influence to gain control over sizable armies of demonic creatures They were also the sworn enemies of the devils though their ageless Blood War came to a cool upon Asmodeus ascendance to godhood The githyanki are a race of psionic humanoids formerly dominated by the mind flayers They escaped their bondage and now reside in fortresses in the Astral Plane The origin of the gith race before their enslavement was largely unknown Not even the original name of the race was remembered but it was referred to by some as the forerunners Some sources claimed that they were originally humans from a world called Pharagos In all accounts the forerunners had at some point become slaves of the illithids a race devoted to mentally dominating sentient humanoids to work as the backbone of their vast empire and were transformed through selective breeding and genetic experiments for several millennia After eventually developing mental resistance to their masters mind control the slaves revolted Led by Gith the several rebellious factions united thus causing the fall of the illithid empire Not satisfied with regaining their freedom and splintering the illithids empire Gith advocated for a campaign of total annihilation of the mind flayers and the subsequent destruction of any race that could potentially enslave them again However a faction within the society fostered peace arguing that the race should focus on rebuilding their society in seclusion instead of persisting in a tyrannical conflict Led by Zerthimon the splinter faction started undermining the githyanki s war efforts After a long civil war Zerthimon was killed and the githyanki moved to the Astral Plane The defeated faction who called themselves githzerai retreated to Limbo A third faction chose to relocate to wildspace to hunt down spacefaring mind flayers They were known as the pirates of Gith In the aftermath of the civil war the once slave race had been splintered into the githyanki and the githzerai the latter of whom were hated by the githyanki because their betrayal allowed the surviving illithids to retreat to isolated subterranean strongholds The two races then began pursuing their separate agendas but they grew a deep hatred of each other and were at war ever since Years after their exile in the Astral Plane during the continuing war with the illithids Gith s advisor Vlaakith I suggested that she search for allies in the Outer Planes in particular from Tiamat Gith agreed to visit the Nine Hells for an audience but never returned Instead the red dragon envoy Ephelomon returned with a pledge from Tiamat that all red dragons would be allies to the githyanki and that a small contingent of red dragons would serve them as steeds The envoy also decreed that Vlaakith I and her descendants would rule the githyanki in Gith s stead Vlaakith I also played a crucial role in securing the githyanki s position in the Astral Plane Ephelomon remained Vlaakith s consort ever since I was wondering the same thing

other NPCs to stay at a camp and there are some quests that can only be advanced once you ve rested at a Camp When your characters use their spells slots they need to rest at camp to refresh them You can also interact with your companions at the Camp and do actions such as discussing the Quests or advancing Romances You can fast travel to the campsite anytime outside battles arriving campsite this way triggers the day time version of the location As mentioned above a Camp is your temporary shelter where you and your Companions can rest You can also invite other NPCs to stay at a camp and certain quests can only progress after you ve rested at a camp Resting at a camp is essential for refreshing your character s spell slots You can interact with your Companions within a camp engage in discussions about Quests and have deeper interactions with certain companions to further romantic relationships Besides resting at a Camp you will have the opportunity to interact with your Companions on a more personal level Engage in conversations and get to know them better You will also see an exclamation mark above your companion s head that may indicate a new important conversation You can also receive unique companion quests that can be advanced or resolved within a Camp Take your time in getting to know your companions and learn more about them this can strengthen your bond with them The Camp is the best place to strategize and recuperate from your last combat engagement It is also the best place to make important decisions about your next course of action Try to discuss quest options and choose your dialogue options wisely as this can significantly impact the story You will have the option to change the current members of your active party To make a Companion stay within a Camp simply initiate a conversation with them and ask them to stay there and they will leave the party Conversely you can also ask a companion to join you Do note that asking a companion to join you will end in a positive response only if your active team doesn t consist of 4 people already The Camp is the best location to strengthen your bond and grow your relationships with your Companions While you re at the Camp screen while you are resting you can engage in deeper interactions and conversations with them As your companions confidence in you grows you will have the chance to initiate romantic dialogues commencing a potential romance Successfully initiating a romantic relationship with a Companion will unlock new dialogue options that can potentially lead to deeper intimacy You can visit the Romance Guide page to learn more about the different romanceable characters and how you can romance them in Baldur s Gate 3 To set up camp you need to select the Long Rest option located within the campfire icon on the right side of the UI You would also need 40 Camp Supplies in order to take a Long Rest and this will fully restore your Hit Points and Spell Slots A Short Rest will not require you to spend any Camp Supplies but it will only restore your Hit Points and Spell Slots to a certain degree It is important to take note that if you select Long Rest the game will advance into the next day this will restore your Character and Companions HP and remove any negative status effects applied to any of them You need to be careful that you don t have any time sensitive quests active when you choose the Long Rest option as it will automatically fail Within the Camp there is what s called a Storage Box You can put all unwanted items within the box without fear that they will be lost from your inventory Your party can easily be overloaded with items and the Storage Box is a great way to deal with the inventory limit It is recommended that you put unnecessary heavy objects within the storage box this includes some weapons and armor that you don t currently need at the moment Equip and manage your gear and manage your items efficiently Properly equipping your character and companions will greatly enhance your party s combat capabilities and overall effectiveness There are certain NPCs that you will meet as you progress through the game that may appear in the camp This will usually occur if you ve met a certain NPC and invited them to your Camp For example you will find Withers The Hooded Skeleton during the quest Explore the Ruins This NPC is impossible to miss and will eventually show up in your camp Withers can then offer his services of resurrecting a fallen companion for 200 Gold Resting in Baldur s Gate 3 whether or not it be at Camp will be your main means of replenishing depleted resources There are three types of rests each with varying lengths requirements and benefits A Short Rest is as its name implies a period in which your party takes a quick break from adventuring Taking a short rest will advance the in game time by 15 minutes and does not have any supply requirements Short Rests are great for recovering certain resources particularly Hit Points HP without needing to retreat from the area and you can take one at anytime while out of combat by clicking on the closed eye icon in the top right of your screen by the map In D D you would be able to recover Health by spending a number of Hit Dice determined by your class However in Baldur s Gate 3 you will heal half your maximum Hit Points during a Short Rest instead Besides HP some Classes will regain charges of their special class Actions Features on a Short Rest Warlocks for instance are the only spell casters that can fully replenish their used Spell Slots on a Short Rest Other notable Features that replenish on a short rest are Paladin s and Cleric s abilities to summon the holy power of their Oath Deities through Channel Oath and Channel Divinity respectively and the Fighter s ability to regain Actions through Action Surge Weapon specific Actions such as Backbreaker for Warhammers are also replenished on a short rest If you are unsure about which Actions come back on a Short rest be sure to check it s description or hover over it s icon on your HUD You only have two charges of Short Rests after which you will have to take a Long Rest to regain both charges or have a Bard perform the Song of Rest to replenish one charge Before taking a Long Rest you must fast travel back to Camp by clicking on the campfire icon on the top right of your screen You can fast travel at any time and place so long as you are out of combat and there are no visible threats in the vicinity When in Camp interact with a Bedroll to open up a menu and choose to spend 40 Supplies to take a Long Rest This will fast forward the game to the next day so make sure you re keeping track of any time sensitive quests that are currently active Each Food Drink as well as Supply Pack provides the party with a varying number of Camp Supplies Taking a Long Rest will fully restore the party s Hit Points HP and Spell Slots as well as any Actions Spells or Features that have charges or cooldowns and Items with special uses This is also the prime time to advance your Companion Quests and view unique cutscenes with them Do note that in Early Access you can only encounter one cutscene bonding moment with each Companion per Long Rest even if you took steps to be eligible for more To view more Camp cutscenes with your Companions you will have to take more Long Rests If you are low on Camp Supplies and have no means to get some more or if you don t have any need for the full effect of a Long Rest when interacting with a Bedroll you can choose to take a Partial Long Rest instead You do not need to spend any Camp Supplies for a Partial Rest but all party members will only recover half their maximum Hit Points like during a Short Rest and half of their maximum Spell Slots Time will pass as if you ve taken a Long Rest but any missing Short Rest charges will not be replenished This is a decent option to take if you re not hurting for more HP or Spell Slots but still want to return to camp to rest and interact with your Companions Resting at camp will advance the in game timer causing certain time sensitive quests to fail Some events will only be triggered after some rest including Astarion suck your blood Dreamlover scenes etc Withers The hooded skeleton you find in quest Explore the Ruins will appear in camp and provide revival services He can also respec your characters and provide Hirelings Scratch the dog you find outside Blighted Village will also appear in camp pet him to get the approval of your companions Alfira the

File Manager Members Page Manager Settings Create Wiki Back to top New Player Help for Baldur s Gate 3 features numerous pieces of information that will help a player understand the basics of the game s mechanics as well as recommended things to do before starting the game This page s focus is to help both new and veteran players to further understand the game and to know what it has to offer Character Creation starts with the decision of crafting a personalized character through a custom Build or opting for one of the provided Origins which feature pre designed characters complete with distinct backstories and dialogue Opting for a custom Build unlocks a plethora of supplementary choices to shape and define your character uniquely Players are allowed tailor the following aspects as part of their customization process For newcomers to the game who prefer not to opt for an Origin character but are interested in experimenting with a custom build they have the option to explore a range of pre made Builds crafted by fellow players These pre made Builds cater to various play styles and can be a suitable alternative When creating a Build it s crucial to consider how your character might interact with or augment different Companions Some of these Companions are available for selection on the Origins page on Character Creation If you decide not to bring these specific Companions into your party there s an alternative choice of utilizing Hirelings These Hirelings are available to all classes and similar to the Companions can be Respecced to better align with your personal interest aided by a certain enigmatic undead character This allows for a versatile approach to building your group enhancing the flexibility of your party composition After you ve made the decision to create a personalized character the initial step is to choose a Race There s a sequence of steps provided in the Character Creation menu but each page might contain a lot of information which could be overwhelming for new players So take it one step at a time carefully go through all the available details and select what interests you Understand that achieving a flawless playthrough might not be possible and your Companions might not always share your views or even make it through the journey It s even possible that you won t come up with a Build you re satisfied with on your first attempt However Baldur s Gate 3 encourages players to explore various Classes and combinations especially with the introduction of the new Multiclassing feature and the option to Respec There are a few top things to consider when choosing a race which boils down to the available Race Features Movement Speed Proficiencies and Subraces The most flexible of these is the available Proficiencies which may then be balanced out with your Class choice For those who do not mind spoilers or what to look at the whole picture before approaching a build you can take a look at all available Items Weapons and Armor in the game to see what requirements and Proficiences are needed in order to equip the items you want Your stats and choices will be displayed on the character bar on the left as you go through the different character creation menu options For the rest of the things to consider just note that the size and build of each Race will also affect their Movement in the game When selecting a Class it is crucial to take personal interests into account The Barbarian is strongly recommended for beginners owing to its highly enjoyable gameplay mechanics In combat Barbarians utilize Rage which provides proficiency in both Melee and Ranged combat On the other hand for a more prudent gameplay approach the Druid Class offers both offensive and supportive capabilities The options are limitless but the primary focus should always be on having fun Flexibility in the game is enhanced by Multiclassing and Respeccing options This allows players to experiment with different class combinations without needing a complete restart For comprehensive insights and detailed comparisons of all available classes refer to the Classes page The variety of Backgrounds will influence your initial Proficiencies This connects with the concept of Itemization and guides you in determining the Proficiencies necessary for the Items Equipment and successful interactions you aim for Presented below are the selectable Backgrounds accompanied by their respective Proficiencies Baldur s Gate 3 takes its foundation from the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons a role playing game system introduced in 2014 Renowned as the most recent iteration of the pen paper RPG series the 5th edition offers the framework upon which Baldur s Gate 3 builds its immersive experience Dungeons and Dragons employs a unique system centered around the d20 a twenty sided die This iconic polyhedral instrument is integral to resolving complex encounters and navigating a wide array of scenarios within the vast tapestry of the game world Dice rolls assume a vital role in every action you undertake whether it involves engaging in combat or participating in dialogue In the present configuration dice rolls are presented at the center of the screen while interacting with NPCs Your desire is to receive a favorable roll and with luck you can actually sway its result If you re fortunate you possess the ability to shape its outcome Employing spells whether your own or those of your Companions can enhance the likelihood of NPCs aligning with your perspective Nevertheless it s important to bear in mind that casting a spell requires the use of Spell Slots so prudent selection is advised To illustrate consider the scenario where you choose to begin by casting Enhance Ability This initial step takes into account the Advantage bonus allowing you to roll the dice twice By doing so you significantly heighten the likelihood of tilting the odds in your favor On the other hand another viable option is to utilize the Guidance spell This spell too serves as an effective choice elevating your prospects for achieving success In Dungeons Dragons attributes are called Abilities This encompasses Strength Dexterity Constitution Intelligence Wisdom and Charisma This can be confusing because every other RPG uses the term abilities to refer to Skills of a character or some other active or passive function they possess It s the number that represents each ability stat of your character On the other hand ability modifier is the bonus or penalty you gain from your ability score of each ability To determine an ability modifier subtract 10 to the ability score then divide the result by two rounded down For example if you have 20 Strength your ability score is 21 and your ability modifier 21 10 11 is 5 11 2 5 If you have 6 Wisdom then your ability Score is 6 6 10 4 and your ability modifier is 2 4 2 2 Both ability scores and ability modifiers determine how successful your character is at various things throughout the game Ability Checks are rolled when performing actions within the game world testing the character s Abilities and often appear in dialogue Ability checks are accompanied by something called DC or Difficulty Class Difficulty class is the number you must roll with the d20 to pass the ability check The task difficulty when performing a DC are For Nearly impossible cases you have to have a very high ability modifier other bonuses and almost a perfect 20 roll on the die For example if you are trying to open a door you cannot open and it has a Strength check DC of 15 Your character has 18 Strength so he has an Ability modifier 4 So if you try to force it open you have to roll the d20 and add 4 to that result If the result is higher than 15 the door will be forced However if you should fail the roll nothing or something bad may happen like for example jamming the door and making it impossible to open All of these operations are calculated by the game automatically and you can check the results at the bottom of the screen Attack rolls occur when a character is attacking another character The attacking character rolls the d20 and if the roll is equal or higher than the target s Armor Class AC then that attack hits the target with the equipped weapon Melee weapons use the Strength ability modifier while Ranged Weapons use the Dexterity ability modifier There are some exceptions such as melee weapons that have the finesse property These melee weapons use Dexterity instead of Strength If you successfully connect the attack your ability modifier is then added to your damage roll Damage rolls are calculated by rolling the die or dice of the weapon used and then adding the ability modifier This means that you are not only more likely to hit with the weapon if you have high Strength or Dexterity but you will do more damage if you do Saving throws are used to calculate the defense of a character against many effects or Spells in the game Each of these has its own DC which the character must make a saving throw of the die against in order to protect themselves These Spells or effects will target one of the six Abilities of the player and they will use that specific ability modifier when rolling Just like ability checks and attack rolls you must hit the target number or higher in order to succeed If you are making a spellcasting character like a Wizard or Sorcerer you want to have the highest DC you can on your Spells because this will make it harder for Enemies to successfully rolling a Saving Throw Such as is the case with Weapons each Spellcasting class uses a different Ability that is used to calculate the Spellcasting Ability modifier The DC to resist one of your spells is calculated is always 8 Spellcasting Ability Modifier For example if your Druid casts the spell Call Lightning around a bunch of Goblins The Druid s Wisdom is 23 so he has a Spellcasting Ability Modifier of 6 This means the DC of this Spell is 14 8 6 Any Goblin who doesn t roll at least draw 14 will take 3d10 damage The sum of three rolls of a d10 die and any who does will take half that amount Advantage and disadvantage are applied to the roll of the d20 Advantage means that you roll the d20 two times when making an Attack Roll Ability Check or Saving Throw and use the higher of the two values On the other hand disadvantage means that you roll the d20 two times but in this case use the lower of the two values Disadvantage is one of the worst situations you can be on when rolling on D D and should be avoided at all costs While advantage nearly doubles your chance of success and should be sought out All characters in D D 5th edition have what it s called a Proficiency Bonus This is a positive modifier that increases as your character gains levels and work somewhat similarly to ability modifiers because it is added to d20 rolls Each player character begins the game with a proficiency level of 2 increasing 1 every four levels to a maximum of 6 Proficiency bonus is the same for all characters at the same level regardless of Class or Race Proficiency bonus is only added to your d20 rolls of things that you have proficiency in These are determined by your Race Class Background and Feats This means that you will only get this roll at things your character is good at For example Proficiency bonus is not added to the damage roll In 5th edition D D players do not receive a penalty for attacking with Weapons they are not proficient with but instead do not gain their proficiency bonus And when using Armor or Shields they are not proficient with they have disadvantage on any ability check saving throw or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity and they cannot cast Spells Using armors you are not proficient with should be avoided at all costs Skills are used throughout the game to overcome obstacles What skills you have and which you are proficient with will be determined during Character Creation and are usually tied to your Class Race and Background Each skill in the game falls within an ability and are esentially a specific aspect of that ability Tools are items that can help a player do something they wouldn t otherwise be able to do they are not tied to a specific ability Feats in Baldur s Gate 3 work like talents or perks in other RPGs giving the character a very specific bonus Players don t gain Feats automatically Players gain an Ability Score point every 4 levels At level 4 8 12 16 and finally 19 and can opt out of this ability score improvement to instead take a Feat Humans and Fighters gain additional Feats Not all Feats can be used by everyone the Heavily Armored Feat for example requires to have Medium Armor Proficiency to be unlocked In Baldur s Gate 3 you can use any weapon you wish on any character but you will not gain your proficiency bonus when attacking if you aren t proficient with said weapon You won t be penalized for using a weapon you are not proficient with but the likelihood of hitting an enemy is reduced because you don t get the added benefit of proficiency Every characters Weapon proficiency is determined by their Race and Classes For example Elves gain proficiency with Longswords Shortswords shortbow and longbows Wizards gain proficiency with Daggers Darts Slings Quarterstaffs and Light Crossbows This means that if you create an Elven Wizard you ll have proficiency with all 9 of those weapon types Each Weapon has a damage type that is either Bludgeoning Piercing or Slashing This is something to be aware of because some Enemies have damage reductions to certain types of damage Armor Class is what protects you from any attack that uses an attack roll Spells included The amount of protection you gain depends on how heavy the armor you are wearing is For example Padded Armor gives you 11 AC which means an enemy must reach a total of 11 on the attack roll to hit you When wearing lighter armor players gain a benefit to their armor class from their Dexterity When wearing Light Armor you gain the full value of your Dexterity modifier added to your Armor Class When wearing Medium Armor you gain up to 2 AC from your Dexterity modifier and when wearing Heavy Armor you gain no benefit from your Dexterity modifier at all Unlike Weapons proficiency in an armor type is a must have or you ll be facing some serious penalties Characters who wear armor they aren t proficient in will have disadvantage on any Ability Check Saving Throw or Attack Roll that involves Strength or Dexterity and they can t cast Spells The other two important things to pay attention to when wearing armor are whether or not they give you disadvantage on Stealth checks and when using Heavy Armor whether there is a Strength requirement or not Multiclassing is a feature that will be implemented upon the release of Baldur s Gate 3 This is the ability to switch to another Class or Character and can be done in game mid game and will allow players to reallocate some of their scores In order to allow all different class combinations Larian removed Ability Score Prerequisites seen in 5e DND So there s no more need to get your Charisma up to a pesky 13 if you decide to make a soul pact with a playful archfey or dangerous fiend You can Multiclass into anything your roleplay and build desires demand In short this means warriors will be able to wield arcane spells rogues can master divine magic spellcasters may dabble in martial prowess and you ll have the

strong enough to hold Thrown targets can cause damage Some can create surfaces Most Potions can work if you simply throw it on other characters For example if you throw a Potion of Healing on a

for weapon dip Extra fire damage can make a lot of combats much easier The Dash action allows you to double your movement speed Use Shove to get a target out of your way or to move an ally to safety

switch One handed Dual wield the second will always trigger the Bonus Action offhand attack when you click to attack An icon should also appear in your hotbar to optionally use or not the offhand attack recommended method Destroy objects even chests by holding the Ctrl key while you attack the object Note this can destroy the contents at least in Early Access so it is not recommended You can

want to check an overview for a recommended progress path you may visit our Game Progress Route page NOTE The Walkthrough page for Baldur s Gate 3 BG3 will mainly focus on the Main Questline and some other important quests that take place in a recommended order of locations For a full guide on the different events dialogues and encounters you can find in a location please visit the Locations page or the Quests page to find a specific quest walkthrough Yes The story takes place 100 years after the events in Baldur s Gate 2 and shortly after the events of Descent into Avernus a 5e Tabletop campaign Baldur s Gate 3 takes place right after the events of Descent into Avernus The holy city of Elturel disappeared from the Forgotten Realms and descended into Avernus the first layer of the Nine Hells In our canon it was saved by a party of heroes The game is based on the 5th edition ruleset of D D and was created closely together with Wizards of the Coast When you first begin Baldur s Gate 3 you will be treated to an intense cinematic depicting a Mindflayer and its ship and their assault on the city You will then see a group of Dragon Riders teleport into this space to attack the ship which triggers a chase scene across realms Those new to D D lore will be confused by the events so this is an executive summary of the key points you must understand 1 Mindflayers reproduce by infecting other races with tadpoles after a certain time the creature will take control of the host and convert it into a Mindflayer They are also known for their great psionic power that allows them to control and enslave other creatures whose brains they consume 2 The Dragon Riders that appear are the Githyanki a tribe within a race that used to be enslaved by the Mindflayers After successfully emancipating themselves from the Mindflayer mind control they set up in the Astral Plane and created a pact with deity Tiamat that a small group of Red Dragons would be their mounts The Githyanki despise and wish to annihilate all Mind Flayers Click to jump to a specific section of the page BG3 Nautiloid Main Quest s BG3 Nautiloid All Quests This quest will also serve as the Tutorial section of the game Upon starting the quest you ll begin with escaping your pod amidst the commotion Check the other Mind Flayer Pod X 48 Y 434 and you ll realize that there might be other survivors As you explore further you ll see an unstable Nursery in the middle X 51 Y 422 Once you get close enough the Narrator explains that this is where the parasite that s writhing behind your eye came from You will have three options If you choose the second option a prompt will pop up explaining how Skill Checks work In certain dialogue situations you will need to roll a die and meet or exceed the target number which is the Difficulty Class DC number you ll see on the screen required in order to successfully initiate the dialogue option you ve chosen Some characters will already have skills that can give them an advantage in certain dice rolls For this instance this character has a 1 Intelligence bonus so whatever number it gets it will add a 1 to the number The DC for this is 10 and if you fail the skill check you will have two options If you choose the first option after failing the skill check the Nursery will explode On the second level there are several cartilaginous chests X 47 Y 436 that contain some Potions and other misc items When you navigate this region you can use the jump Action to cross gaps and fires to loot bodies on the other side If you get damaged by the fire you can interact with the Restoration to recover your health Now move on to the next room by interacting with the Sphincter X 28 Y 424 Once you proceed to the next area the game will explain about the Map and show the different markers on the left side of the screen In this next area you will find more potions and scrolls on dead Imps Now get on top of the platform in the middle X 0 Y 427 where you ll see one of the Neural Apparatus it will then lift you to reach the higher ground You ll then notice a victim you can interact with named Myrnath X 0 Y 430 The first few dialogue options won t affect anything regardless of what you choose If you have an Intelligence Arcana Bonus the narrator will say that you ve realized you re currently talking to an Intellect Devourer a minion of the Mind Flayers that abducted you Once the Intellect Devourer begs for your help you will then have to choose among 4 options If you choose the first option and you succeeded in the skill check with DC 10 your character will notice a swelling of the brain causing pressure where it strains against the shell of the skull You will have another 5 options to choose from Depending on your character some dialogue options will turn out better than others In this case this character has a 2d20 Advantage when choosing the third dialogue option which is attempting a cerebral extraction You would need to pass a skill check with DC 10 for this An Advantage lets you roll two dice and take the higher result before adding modifiers Once you ve successfully met or succeeded the target number you can choose to let it accompany you and aid you in your adventures by sparing the brain This newborn Intellect Devourer could provide valuable information If you choose to spare the brain it will tell you that you must go to the helm There are multiple dialogue options during this conversation but in the end it all leads you to where the brain wants you to go If you choose to help the brain you will have gained a follower Some allies may temporarily join you and you can also directly control their movement and actions by clicking on their character portrait on the left side of the screen As you continue forward you ll encounter Lae zel X 39 Y 430 a female Githyanki Fighter who can become one of your potential Companions Join her to fight the imps you ll encounter ahead X 45 Y 402 Before you engage in combat a prompt will pop up on the screen explaining how combat works in Baldur s Gate 3 This game features a turn based combat system meaning you have to plan carefully at each encounter Every participant in combat will get a turn and the game also pauses around you during combat meaning you will have time to think about your next move See our Combat page to learn more about the Combat mechanics in Baldur s Gate 3 During your turn you are allowed to move take an action and take a bonus action The green icon you ll see below represents your Actions the orange triangle icon represents your Bonus Actions After you finish your turn click the button labeled End Turn located on the right corner of your Hotbar to end your turn For this fight it is recommended that you use the Intellect Devourer as your tank and lure the Imps out one by one when taking them out Be careful not to get surrounded as Imps can move fast and have ranged attacks you may also not have the chance to heal once you get surrounded If you are using a Class that can use Find Familiar use it to gain an advantage in combat Unlike in BG1 and BG2 the death of your familiar won t cause a permanent decrease in Health Note the Nautiloid of the Final released version of BG3 is a bit different from the EA version The outer decks are removed Once you finished fighting Imps with Lae zel you will directly enter the chamber with Shadowheart s pod After defeating the Imps loot the items from their corpses and heal yourself using the Restoration if needed Then move forward to the deck The Dragons attack and the fights between imps and thralls have lefts tons of bodies on deck you can loot golds potions scrolls and all sorts of items on them Climb the Arterial Mesh X 43 Y 367 you will immediately see as you proceed to get to the next area X 31 Y 356 Upon entering the room you ll find a control panel in the middle X 11 Y 354 The various slates in the rooms that are above the buttons have their text hidden behind a DC 15 Arcana skill check The three slates in the first room you go to read in order from left to right Unleash Aggression Annihilate The Unleash button plays a short scene but ultimately does nothing The middle button will cause the thralls to attack you while the rightmost button will instantly kill them On the left side of the room you ll see another Mind Flayer Pod with someone inside the chamber X 3 Y 347 You will also notice a control panel beside it As you approach the pod Shadowheart a Shar priest and a potential Companion tells you to get her out of there Lae zel insists that we leave her as we don t have much time From here you will have 5 dialogue options Depending on your character choosing the fourth option will require you to pass a skill check with DC 7 successfully passing the skill check will allow you to control the console and release her later on Now interact with the console on your right You will then have 4 options Again this will depend on your unique character for this instance choosing the third option and successfully passing the skill check will prompt another action you can choose From here you will have another three options If you choose the second option you will need to pass another skill check with DC 10 After successfully passing the skill check you will notice that the control panel looks more like a beating heart than a machine from here you can touch the control panel And from here you have two options Choosing the first option will require you to pass another skill check with DC 2 Successfully passing the skill check will release Shadowheart from the pod Interact with Shadowheart and speak to her you can choose to make her your companion if you let her accompany you to the helm Now proceed to the next area you can find a Gold Key on a corpse X 28 Y 354 just as you enter you can use this to open an elaborate chest In the middle of the room you ll see another woman trapped inside a Mind Flayer Pond X 46 Y 354 North of the room you ll see another corpse on the ground X 61 Y 353 she will have a Bronze Necklace and an Eldritch Rune that you can loot Once you interact with the control panel the woman inside the pod will start to transform but cannot attack you as it will stay inside the pod Now make your way to the helm X 20 Y 389 Once you reach the area you will witness the mind flayers and devils fighting You will then immediately engage in combat after the short cutscene You can focus on defeating the imps while ignoring Commander Zhalk as he ll focus on fighting the Mind Flayer Once you reach the other side of the helm more imps will appear This battle will be a race against time as you will need to reach the Transponder before the Nautiloid crashes You will see on the right side of the screen how many turns you have left before the Nautiloid crashes Do note that you can also kill Commander Zhalk and loot the Everburn Blade from him 2d6 1d4 fire However once you kill him the Mind Flayer will turn hostile and some Cambions will appear in the area and start to attack After clearing them out and connecting the transponder the Nautiloid will leave Avernus This marks the end of the prologue and the next quest Find a Cure will start shortly after Ravaged Beach Main Quest s BG3 Ravaged Beach All Quests As you begin the quest you ll find yourself at the Ravaged Beach Continue following the path ahead and you ll find Shadowheart unconscious on the ground X 271 Y 217 Interact with her and you will have three options to choose from Choosing the first option will wake her up she ll then ask how it s possible you re both alive From here you have two options to choose from Choosing the first option will prompt her to say that she only remembers the ship and falling down from the ship and then nothing You will then have to choose among three responses If you choose the second option she ll say that she doesn t recognize the place She ll then go on to say that you first need to find supplies shelter and most important of all a healer for the monsters living inside your head This will prompt 3 more dialogue options Choosing the first option will make her say that you both need each other and she can t think of a better company And then you will have the option to go together or part ways with the dialogue options that will appear Choosing the first option will allow you to have Shadowheart accompany you but before you continue with your journey she thanks you for freeing her from the pod back in Nautilod You ll then get an approval up from her As you proceed you ll find an Ancient Sigil Circle on the wall X 285 Y 296 just beside the Ancient Door in the Overgrown Ruins When you interact with the Ancient Door it won t open Shadowheart will suggest looking for another entrance Head west and you ll a couple of Intellect Devourers in the area X 259 Y 279 Try to keep your distance throughout the fight to make quick work of them these are low level enemies but can be dangerous once you re surrounded by a group of them Once you ve slain all the Intellect Devourers explore the area and loot what you can then head west Continue following the main path and you will come across the destroyed Nautiloid wreck then slightly up a hill you ll find Astarion a High Elf vampire and a potential Companion calling for help X 176 Y 284 He says he s cornered one of the Intellect Devourers hiding in the grass He then asks if you can kill it just like how you killed the others From here you will have three options to choose from Choosing the first option will reveal that this was just a trap the boar comes out of the grass and Astarion suddenly takes a stance with his dagger You will have three options to choose from Choosing the first option will make Astarion suspicious of you as he says he saw you get out of the ship of the mind flayers before being interrupted by the worms in your brains He asks what happened and you will have to choose from these options Choosing the first option will make Astarion calm down and get ahold of the situation He then apologizes you now have three dialogue options to choose from If you choose the second option Astarion will then introduce himself and say he was in Baldur s Gate when those mind flayers snatched him You then have three dialogue options to choose from You can choose any of the options above he ll then ask if you know anything about the worms You have three options to choose from You can choose any of the options above and then he ll suggest that maybe if you can find someone who can control these things there might still be time You then have four options to choose from Choosing the first option will give you the same three options from above If you choose the first option he ll tag along and accompany you as you proceed Now head northeast to the crash site you ll notice footprints in the area there are dead goblins on the ground and you can loot some items and supplies from their corpses Continue following the path then head southwest you ll encounter an injured mind flayer in the area X 180 Y 325 Interact with it and you ll have three options to choose from Choosing the first option will give you two more options to choose from Choosing the first option and succeeding the skill check will reveal that you can offer yourself to the mind flayer for sustenance this will give you another two dialogue options Choosing the second option and succeeding the skill check will prevent you to give yourself in Now you notice the mind flayer exhausted and its eyes radiate with malice You now have two options to choose from Choosing the first option will make your character stomp the mind flayer s head and kill it You can then loot its corpse for some items Now head north then climb the platform and continue following the road uphill your character will then make a remark that you heard shouting up ahead Shadowheart will follow up with a comment that we should check it out Along the way you ll come across a dirt mound with a shovel sticking out You can dig it and uncover a chest you can loot the items inside the chest if you wish to do so As you move forward you ll find Lae zel trapped in a wooden cage and two Tieflings discussing whether to kill her or leave her to the goblins X 242 Y 357 You are able to communicate with Lae zel even without actually speaking to each other via the monsters inside your head Lae zel tells you to get rid of the Tieflings you will have to select from these options Choosing the second option will make Lae zel communicate with you telepathically and tell you she knows a cure for the things living inside our heads Shadowheart then reminds you that Lae zel was keen on leaving her to die when you were all within the Nautiloid and that you can t trust her You will have to choose among these four choices Choosing the first option will require you to pass a skill check successfully doing so will make the tieflings agree with you Damays will then mention something about checking the blast You can either ask about it or leave Asking for specifics will make Damays reveal that the blast shook their camp and that s why they went out to take a look Now you can use Persuasion to ask where the camp is or leave Choosing the first option will require you to pass a skill check successfully passing the skill check will make Damays tell you the location of the camp He says it s located northwest and once you make it there look for Nettie Nymessa then joins the conversation by telling you to be careful as there are goblin traps everywhere Once the tieflings leave Lae zel demands you to set her free and your next set of choices will look like this Choosing the second option will not make Lae zel say the word Astarion and Shadowheart will approve of this decision You can then attempt to free her after the dialogue After freeing Lae zel interact with her to initiate conversation She then says the longer we wait the more the parasite consumes She also says that her people possess the cure for this infection and she wants you to join her in looking for a Crèche Shadowheart steps into the conversation and tells you to be careful she warns you to not let her take advantage of you as she sees your kindness as a weakness Your next set of choices will look like this The two choices that will matter are choices 3 and 4 The first two choices will only extend the conversation When asked about a crèche Lae zel explains that it is many things it is a hatchery a training ground and a shelter She also explains to you about the Githyanki protocol Choosing the second option will make her say that the cure will suffice as thanks Now you must decide whether or not to journey with her or go your separate ways If you choose to join her Shadowheart will disapprove of this decision She then says that she trusts your judgment but she doesn t trust Lae zel yet Lae zel then explains that since the tieflings mentioned a camp there s one tiefling named Zorru who has seen githyanki She suggests we ask Zorru where he has seen the other githyankis Continue heading south then head west you ll see an unstable rune on the wall X 224 Y 324 Interact with it you can then touch it or leave it be Choosing the first option will make your character try to touch the sigil but then a slight shock would prevent you from doing so An arm then extends out asking for help Your next set of choices will look like this The first two options can be chosen without affecting anything Choices 3 5 are the ones that will affect the story Choosing the third or fourth option will require you to pass a skill check in order to get him out of that portal After successfully pulling him out of the portal he

option will make him say that he assumes you were also infected with the parasite inside your brain You can choose to extend the conversation or tell him it s none of his business These are the options you have to choose from Choosing the first option will reveal that the process you and your current companions are going through is called Ceremorphosis where after a certain period of time the parasite that entered our brain will turn us into mind flayers He then asks if you happen to be a cleric You have these options to choose from Choosing the third option will then make him say that you should look for a healer together you have two choices here Even if you choose the first option Gale would not join you right away and says that you have plenty of company already He says that he

toll on her before she notices you Choosing the first choice will have her express that she s full glad to have you as their little miracle against the darkness She ll proceed to enchant you and your party with the same shield she s cast around the inn but will warn you that it won t be enough to protect you when you reach the depths of the Shadow Cursed Lands though it should be enough to reach Moonrise Towers If you ve brought Shadowheart along with you she ll get stung by the Spell and ask her lady Shar for forgiveness As she gives you advice on how to best Ketheric you get interrupted by Flaming Fist Marcus a former brave ally of theirs now turned by the Enemy in exchange for a pair of wings You ll have the following options to react with After she introduces him to you he ll reveal

enter a combat engagement If you brought Shadowheart along she ll gain inspiration from having a Selunite spell cast on her For this fight you ll have to attempt to defeat Flaming Fist Marcus and six Winged Horrors All of them are going to do their best to go straight of Isobel Your best bet for a small chance of winning here is to use a protection spell on Isobel while you dish out as much damage as you can on Marcus before he knocks Isobel out Chances are however you ll lose this fight due to Marcus sheer bulk and power After he knocks out Isobel all hell will break loose in the inn resulting in the death of most of its inhabitants The shields will disappear allowing the shadows to enter the inn and turn some into Enemies while the others die to the horrors that enter Outside Jaheira will see the shields melt and ask you what happened Choosing the first choice will have her restate your mission to figure out Ketheric s invincibility Before you get out of here to do that though you ll have to clear the area of allies turned to foes This won t be difficult by any means other than the fact that they used to be innocents There ll be another group waiting for you on the bridge to the southeast which is also bring in some Creepers After the fight loot as much as you need and then proceed back to the bridge at X 11 Y 120 to head back to the Ruined Battlefield After crossing the

following options to react If you choose to stay hidden there ll be an internal squabble resulting in Kar niss slaughtering the goblin that noticed you so you ll have one less to kill After that you can either clear your throat and reveal yourself or do a Stealth check to wait for them to pass Choosing the first option will have the drider recognize you as a True Soul and ask how you ve survived the shadows without protection As per your current objective of finding the answer to the same question you can ask him in return how he has survived thus far He ll reveal that the lantern he carries is the key You ll then have the following courses of action to choose from Naturally choosing the third option will result in a fight but there s no telling if he ll give the lantern over anyway Kar niss will likely start the fight with Sanctuary If anyone in your party has Counterspell as a reaction you can stop this Otherwise it s not a bad thing to let it happen as might want to take care of the Enemies with lower health points anyway Thanks to your antics you ll have to clear out the drider two goblins and two Half Orcs Kar niss has a massive amount of health but you should be able to whittle him down easily especially once he s alone Looting him afterward will net you his Moonlantern and the Cruel Sting longsword Taking the Moonlantern will reveal a pixie trapped inside that s responsible for the light that protects against even the deeper shadows A successful Intelligence check will tell you that they can be playful and even malicious Dolly Dolly Dolly the pixie will claim

approval from Astarion and Karlach if you brought them along She ll then ask how she can repay you and you ll have the following options to answer with Choosing the first option will have her toy with you for a bit but ultimately give you a magic bell called the Filigreed Feywild Bell that you can ring for the protection you asked for Continue looting as necessary One of the goblins will have some

to respond to this with If you choose the first option she ll do her usual referencing of their contract Before she leaves you ll do a Perception check here to see if she s hiding anything behind her usual attitude and blurry appearance If you did choose to take a long rest you ll be visited by your Dream Visitor again as you sleep They ll comment on how strong the Absolute s influence is where you are and then commend you for saving the refugees at the grove You can respond with the following options Choosing the first option will have them say it s not a choice just anyone could make

Absolute s mental attacks to transform you have been relentless but they ll reaffirm her resolve to protect you for as long as they can Before leaving camp you can talk to Wyll who ll be quite pissed at his new task You can ask him if this task violates their contract as he was supposed to be killing devils not rescuing them Knowing how Mizora thinks however he confirms that the contract doesn t say anything about saving a devil so the task still stands You can continue the conversation which will end with the resolution to complete the task so he doesn t get turned into a lemure Back to the

Absolute only to betray them once you discover that Nightsong is the relic that Ketheric Thorm was referring to Shadowheart will abandon her duty to Lady Shar by freeing the Nightsong instead of killing her In order to reach the Moonrise Towers you will be traveling in the Shadow Cursed Lands where you will meet different characters of different races At exactly X 156 Y 97 you will see a bridge with glowing lights coming from the ground underneath There s also a Waypoint that you can unlock here Walk towards the bridge where 2 guards will stop you at the foot of the stairs The other one named Zealot Malik will recognize you as True Soul and will begin to act more friendly towards you To respond you can choose from the following Given their friendly nature it s recommended to avoid combat to avoid conflict The goal here is to infiltrate the towers and pretend to be loyal to The Absolute and thus choosing the first option will prompt them to give you information on what s going on inside The other guard Adept Merim tells you that Z rell is waiting in the audience chamber whom she thinks will be wanting to hear from you There are ghouls patrolling on the sides of the entrance but they are not hostile and you can just walk up the stairs to enter the tower Interact with the Heavy Oak Doors and continue to walk towards the center of the tower where you will be welcomed by Zealot Brinn You will notice that there s a Scrying Eye roaming in this area so be careful not to do anything suspicious that will raise their alarms Explore the Main Floor and go to

the potion will be unique to you one that contains your blood essence and The Absolute s blessing intertwined Then you will have the next options to choose from You find out that she keeps the blood for research and does a little bit of experimentation with it Next you can decide if you want to go on with brewing a potion If you agree she will extract blood from you and then as she collects it she will turn her attention to one of your companions Astarion to be specific She mentions that he s a vampire and by this Astarion responds that he won t bite as they are all friends under The Absolute However Araj Oblodra will respond with Oh I prefer if you did and then asks you a question I assume he belongs to you Choosing the first option here will gain Astarion and Karlach s approvals Then Araj will turn her attention to Astarion and she tells him that she has always dreamed of being bitten by a vampire She offers to give you a potion that will increase your strength permanently if you let Astarion bite her However Astarion will refuse her and will instead ask for your help to decide on this matter You will have 3 options If you force Astarion to do this he will disapprove of this however you will gain 2 potions One is unique to your character during our playthrough we got the Elixir of Dragonborn Prowess Fire Then for the other potion Potion of Everlasting Vigour which increases your Strength by 2 permanently You may also interact with Araj Oblodra again to check her wares She s also a trader dealing in Moonrise Towers After you encounter the trader in blood you can

goblins to be killed but one of the unbelievers the one unaffected by the parasite will throw a spear into Thorm s chest in an attempt to kill him However it seems that Thorm is unaffected by this and even asks to try again He demonstrates that he cannot be killed and when he s done he proceeds to kill the rogue goblin swiftly Fezzerk s fate will be handed over to you and you are free to decide on how you want to deal with them If you show mercy on the goblins Astarion will disapprove of this Continue to go around the Main Floor of Moonrise Towers and you will find Lann Tarv who will have a dialogue with Karlach An old friend of hers named Flo wishes to hand over three Soul Coins to her These soul coins can come in handy but you also consider that it s dangerous to accept any offers from

on the beach you will gain 200 experience each This will get you knocking on the door for level 3 before you even run into your first fight once off the ship 3 0 The prologue area was changed in update 5 so if you get the key from the body in the next room then open the chest in the area with Shadowheart in the pod the relic in the chest allows you to access her nearby panel and free her on the crashing ship Well worth doing early because with 3 characters the intellect devourer its possible and easier to kill Commander Zhaik the main demon on the Bridge and acquire his flaming Great

and insert a Mithral Ore This will allow you to use the Forge Lever to lower the Forge and start crafting The Mithral Ore will be consumed when the process is complete Interact with the Mould Chamber and insert one of the Moulds you have Scimitar Mould Shield Mould Mace Mould Splint Mould Longsword Mould and Scale Mail Mould The mold won t be consumed when you craft the item You can extract the mold by interacting with the lever located next to the Mould Chamber this will allow you to insert a new mold Pull the Lava Valve This will cause the Forge to be surrounded by lava Evade at all costs being caught up by the lava Try to position your characters on the big surrounding circles to avoid suffering an immense amount of damage Also notice that the first time you do this you will summon a Golem called Grym Pull the Forge Lever this will make a giant column to impact the mould chamber forging the item you have put into the Mould Chamber in the process Once the item is created use the button located next to the Forge Lever this will take the Forge back to the High Level area You can repeat the process from step 1 by inserting a new Mithral Ore Remember to swap the Mould if you want to create a different Item When you activate the lava and Grym appears your terrain will be limited to the Circles surrounding the anvil part of the forge Avoid passing through the lava at all costs When Grym is standing on lava it gains a status effect called Superheated Only when this status effect is active you can damage the golem This will cause Grym to become vulnerable to Bludgeoning damage lower his Armour Class and make him resistant to Thunder Cold and Force He will remain immune to all other elements Grym will attempt to attack the character that attacks it and hits it first at each turn and set it as Prime Target This can be exploited to use the anvil to deal massive damage to Grym Position a character near the Forge Lever and another one near the anvil s strike position Lure Grym thereby attacking it with that character and once the golem is in position pull the Forge Lever The anvil strikes down dealing 100 points of damage approx and leaving the golem Prone If the Lava is removed interact with the Lava Valve to refill the chamber and force Grym to walk over it Grym won t take damage from the Anvil if he doesn t have the Superheated status effect Previous

You can choose to side with Auntie Ethel or the brothers during the argument the choice doesn t matter much for the Main Quest This conversation will end with Auntie Ethel leaving for her house and marks the beginning of the Side Quest Save Mayrina Auntie Ethel can then be found in the western part of the Sunlit Wetlands at the Gnarled Teahouse Once you enter the teahouse another cutscene will play as a part of Save Mayrina You can be as hostile or as accommodating to Auntie Ethel as you want in this part it won t affect whether or not she s willing to help you with your parasite problem If you are hostile towards her you will get one last chance to get her help near the end of the conversation where she offers to take care of the little bugger The game offers you multiple ways of getting rid of your parasite and you do not have to do this step to complete the Main Quest Find a Cure However if you accept Auntie Ethel s help she will explain that in exchange she wants one of your eyes Agree to the terms and she ll transform into her true form Do note that agreeing with the terms of the deal gets disapproval from all your Companions You will get the Paid the Price

the fight Lassandra will show you where you can go that s safe from the curse You ll have the following choices to reply with Choosing the first will have her explain that the place she mentioned is an inn that s magically protected It also seems like traveling deeper in won t be safe anymore with just torches and light Spells Follow the path to the southwest to move further along You ll eventually spot a raven on the ground Your party will roll Arcana checks to see that the raven has been claimed by the shadows Interacting with it will start a combat engagement against twelve Shadow Cursed Ravens They shouldn t be too hard to get through but you will have the added handicap of being Surprised After the fight you can loot the original raven s body for a note marked HELP There

fourth choice and being successful will have her be satisfied with your answer but explain why she has to be cautious She will say that tracking the parasites led her to someone who should ve been dead for over a century If you ask who it is she ll reveal it to be General Ketheric Thorn the leader of the Absolutist cult It seems that not only is he not dead he s also currently unkillable They had an encounter with him as he and his army were marching to Baldur s Gate Suffice it to say he defeated them and had them chased all the way to this inn However she seems to have some hope in you You can respond to this with the following choices Her plan is to have you infiltrate his base as a True Soul and find out how to deactivate his invincibility You ll have the following options to reply with Choosing the second option will have her explain that you ll probably find a means to cure yourself in the Moonrise Towers anyway You can then ask her how to get there past the debilitating shadows She ll explain that Isobel a Cleric of Selune protects the inn with her light and will be the key that ll let you protect against the darkness She bids you go upstairs to talk to the Cleric at her recommendation Head up the stairs at X 71 Y 134 to get to the second floor Isobel can be found on a balcony to the north which you can reach through a door at X 64 Y 168 You ll see the shielding spell take its toll on her before she notices you Choosing the first choice will have her express that she s full glad to have you as their little miracle against the darkness She ll proceed to enchant you and your party with the same shield she s cast around the inn but will warn you that it won t be enough to protect you when you reach the depths of the Shadow Cursed Lands though it should be enough to reach Moonrise Towers As she gives you advice on how to best Ketheric you get interrupted by Flaming Fist Marcus a former brave ally of theirs now turned by the Enemy in exchange for a pair of wings You ll have the following options to react with After she introduces him to you he ll reveal himself as a True Soul and try to telepathically order you to take Isobel back to their home

minions and you ll enter a combat engagement For this fight you ll have to attempt to defeat Flaming Fist Marcus and six Winged Horrors All of them are going to do their best to go straight of Isobel Your best bet for a small chance of winning here is to use a protection spell on Isobel while you dish out as much damage as you can on Marcus before he knocks Isobel out Chances are however you ll lose this fight due to Marcus sheer bulk and power After he knocks out Isobel all hell will break loose in the inn resulting in the death of most of its inhabitants The shields will disappear allowing the shadows to enter the inn and turn some into Enemies while the others die to the turned Outside Jaheira will see the shields melt and ask you what happened Choosing the first choice will have her restate your mission to figure out Ketheric s invincibility Before you get out of here to do that though you ll have to clear the area of allies turned to foes This won t be difficult by any means other than the fact that they used to be innocents There ll be another group waiting for you on the bridge to the southeast which is also going to bring in some Creepers After the fight proceed to the bridge at X 11 Y 120 to head back to the Ruined Battlefield After crossing the bridge back from Last Light Inn head straight ahead to the path at X 11 Y 9 toward the southeast When the path splits three ways head to the southwest first to your right You ll come across the bodies of cultists and refugees alike Loot as necessary This must be where the ambush happened The path splits three ways here again so head first to the path going up to the west You ll notice some standing torches A successful Arcana check will tell you they re continual flames that can t be put out Follow the path out of this small camp to the southwest You ll come across a dilapidated storehouse right after an arch formed by a tree Passing a Perception check here apprises you of a movable brick by the storehouse s entrance If you look closely inside however there are invisible meazals waiting to ambush you Deal with the meazals however you see fit If you brought Karlach along she ll gain inspiration from being attacked by invisible foes lying in wait Loot as necessary as you explore the storehouse Head back to the entrance and jump on a ledge to the left of the storehouse to then get to the roof Cross the roof to the far end of the storehouse where there s a locked Potter s Chest with a lockpicking DC of 14 containing a pair of Luminous Gloves Head back to the entrance of the storehouse and head up the stairs to the southeast You should see some wooden stairs on your left as you go so head up there head into the ruined house A cutscene will ensue as you watch some cultist pass by led by the drider Kar niss One of them will notice you in the shadows who yells at you to reveal yourself You ll have the following options to react If you choose to stay hidden there ll be an internal squabble resulting in Kar niss slaughtering the goblin that noticed you so you ll have one less to kill After that you can either clear your throat and reveal yourself or do a Stealth check to wait for them to pass Choosing the first option will have the drider recognize you as a True Soul and ask how you ve survived the shadows without protection As per your current objective of finding the answer to the same question you can ask him in return how he has survived thus far He ll reveal that the lantern he carries is the key You ll then have the following courses of action to choose from Naturally choosing the third option will result in a fight but there s no telling if he ll give the lantern over anyway Kar niss will likely start the fight with Sanctuary If anyone in your party has Counterspell as a reaction you can stop this Otherwise it s not a bad thing to let it happen as might want to take care of the Enemies with lower health points anyway Thanks to your antics you ll have to clear out the drider two goblins and two Half Orcs Kar niss has a massive amount of health but you should be able to whittle him down easily especially once he s alone Looting him afterward will net you his Moonlantern and the Cruel Sting longsword Taking the Moonlantern will reveal a pixie trapped inside that s responsible for the light that protects against even the deeper shadows A successful Intelligence check will tell you that they can be playful and even malicious Dolly Dolly Dolly the pixie will claim that she s in constant pain inside the lantern as it s the only way to get the light shining constantly You ll have the following options to respond with Choosing the first option will have the pixie formally introduce itself as Dolly Dolly Dolly and ask you to free her Afterward the first option will be replaced by a proposal to help you travel through the shadows in exchange for freeing her If you choose that option it ll seem to wholeheartedly agree to it Asking about the mechanism will have it claim that it s dangerous for her to even talk about it If you choose to release it you ll gain approval from Astarion and Karlach if you brought them along She ll then ask how she can repay you and you ll have the following options to answer with Choosing the first option will have her toy with you for a bit but ultimately give you a magic bell called the Filigreed Feywild Bell that you can ring for the protection you asked for Continue looting as necessary One of the goblins will have some Thermoarcanic Gloves you can cop Note that the pixie already has you blessed so there s no need to actually use the bell yet There s a locked chest on the southwest side of the house that you can lockpick or you can get the key for it on the roof which you can get to with the ladder You can now safely travel anywhere across the Shadow Cursed Lands Depending on whether or not you ve got Wyll in your party if you rest at camp now Mizora will come for a visit She ll tell you that one of Zariel s devils has been captured by the cultists and brought to Moonrise Towers Wyll s next task as per their pact is to free this devil If you ask why you have to save the devil she ll do her usual referencing of their contract Before she leaves you ll do a Perception check here to see if she s hiding anything behind her usual attitude and blurry appearance If you did choose to take a long rest you ll be visited by your Dream Visitor again as you sleep They ll comment on how strong the Absolute s influence is where you are and then commend you for saving the refugees at the grove You can respond with the following options Choosing the first option will have them say it s not a choice just anyone could make before wincing in pain A successful Perception check will tell you that they re hiding their struggle to protect you You ll have the following options to react with A successful Insight check this time will tell you that despite her disciplined strong demeanor they also need some comfort You ll have the option to give them a hug here They ll appreciate the gesture if you choose to hold them and mention that it s been quite a while since they

you have been relentless but they ll reaffirm her resolve to protect you for as long as they can Before leaving camp you can talk to Wyll who ll be quite pissed at his new task You can ask him if this task violates their contract as he was supposed to be killing devils not rescuing them Knowing how Mizora thinks however he confirms that the contract doesn t say anything about saving a devil so the task still stands You can continue the conversation which will end with the resolution to complete the task so he doesn t get turned into a lemure Back to the ruined house where you fought the drider

journey to the west from here you ll find the door to the House of Healing If you ignore the door and head north you ll come across some Dark Justiciar corpses Continue along the path to eventually

specifics he ll explain that there s an ancient demon ahead lost to time and approaching them risks awakening their plague onto the world if you don t manage to kill it If you want him to be more specific you can try to pass a Persuasion check Afterward you can do an Insight check to see if he s hiding anything else from you Upon further probing you ll learn that it s an Orthon you re after Telling him that he s afraid of this target will have him warn you not to underestimate it Finally he ll assure you that he hasn t forgotten his end of the bargain about translating the scars on Astarion s back Behind him to the southwest is the entrance to the Grand Mausoleum After entering when you go through the iron fence you ll hear a talking skull telling you to beat it but it won t do anything else if you interact with it A part of Ketheric Thorm s diary sits near his diseased wife s coffin Other parts as scattered around this area if you want to look into his past In the eastern

Continue heading north and go through the first Stone Door to enter the first chamber In this area there is a small statue holding an orb You ll get pushed back if you attempt to approach it In order to solve this puzzle you need to explore the side rooms and pull the levers to lower all the lanterns Do note that all rooms with levers will have traps Once you ve pulled all the levers interact with the lowered lanterns to extinguish the light When the room is completely shrouded in darkness you ll see the pattern on the floor Use only one character to crouch walk and avoid the glowing lines to prevent your character from being blasted away Once you touch the orb you will open the door leading to the next area For an easy way to reach the orb in the middle of the forcefield you can use any sort of teleportation and simply teleport directly next to the orb and then click the Umbral Gem Now continue heading west and on the left side of the room X 775 Y 853 you can jump across the platforms that ll lead you to the next area All of your characters should be able to make the jump as the platforms are relatively close to each other You can then go down through the cragged rock X 801 Y 850 As you move forward you ll see a Cloaker in the area If you pass the perception check you ll notice you re going through an area that s perfect for an ambush then you ll initiate combat The Cloaker can summon Phantasms which are basically clones of itself It is recommended that you aim for the main body as killing the Cloaker will make the Phantasms disappear There s a chest at X 824 Y 866 you can loot its treasure Now head north and go down the stairs You ll see a giant locked door You can lockpick or attack it until it breaks down Now head to the room located east and interact

skill check you will gain Nightsinger s Favour you will be resistant to any type of necrotic damage until your next long rest In the room located west there s a traveler s chest and a Key on a Skeleton you can loot X 839 Y 813 Now go to the middle and pull the lever on the left side to open the door ahead As you enter the room you will find three undead skeletons As you approach them the one in the middle asks if you are a friend a foe or a thief Then it will say you re a friend but you were uninvited as he did not request help If you don t attack them they will not turn hostile and even help you during the combat encounter you ll face ahead After your conversation a portal opens up next to you and a Justiciar Avenger comes out You ll then initiate combat after the cutscene This can be a difficult combat encounter as the Umbral Tremors can keep appearing throughout the battle Once you ve slain all the Justiciar enemies go inside the room located west and you ll meet Balthazar X 851 Y 786 Once you interact with him you will be presented with several dialogue options If want you are curious to learn more about him engage in conversation and he will introduce himself as Balthazar the Chief Advisor to General Thorm He reveals that he s here because he was entrusted with an important mission to retrieve a certain relic for General Thorm He also wants to make use of you since you ve proven yourself in battle just recently by slaying some Justiciar enemies You will then be presented with several options if you choose to persuade him and you successfully pass the skill check he will assign someone to aid you as you clear the way He ll offer you the bell that can summon his brother You will gain Astarion and Shadowheart s approval as well as the Summon Golem Bell item This item will summon Balthazar s brother and can only be used in combat while in the Gauntlet of Shar After your conversation with Balthazar you will advance the quest Infiltrate Moonrise Towers Alternatively if you wish to kill Balthazar here right now you will achieve the Acolyte Those for Whom the Bell Tolled if you successfully slay him and his cronies Once you exit the room head north and you ll see a locked Vault Door You need to lockpick the door with DC 30 successfully opening the door will reveal three Opulent Chests inside All the chests will contain valuable loot but the most notable loot is inside the chest in the middle this one has the Scroll of Seeming which is a very rare scroll It s a single use item that lets you disguise up to 4 members of your party Exit the vault and continue heading east at this location X 752 Y 789 you ll find a waypoint that lets you fast travel to this location at any time Now continue heading north and once you reach this location X 652 Y 776 you ll need to pass a perception skill check to reveal the invisible enemies in the area If you get too close or fail the perception check you ll immediately engage in combat Once you ve cleared all the enemies within the area you ll complete the Kill Raphael s Old Enemy quest We recommend checking the enemies corpses as you may find some valuable scrolls and weapons there s an enemy there named Yurgir that has a very rare weapon called the Hellfire Hand Crossbow Once you end the day Raphael will show up Astarion will then make a remark that Raphael needs to hold his end of the deal as his devil Yurgir has been dispatched If you want to learn more about Astarion s back story tell Raphael to stop stalling and he ll reveal the contract that was made by Astarion s former master Cazador Szarr with the archdevil Mephistopheles Once Raphael finishes the story he will vanish Astarion will then ask you if you can help him take the fight to Cazador If you choose to help him you will gain his approval and he will thank you To find the remaining Umbral Gems you need to complete Sharran Trials The Soft step Trial can be found here X 761 Y 755 just northwest of the Gauntlet of Shar Waypoint You ll see a Bulky Door as its entrance Go inside and interact with the Sacrificial Bowl Shadowheart will then interrupt and say this is one of Lady Shar s trials You can then let her do as she wishes or tell her to stand down If you choose to let her do as she pleases you will gain her approval She then wounds herself and offers her blood on the bowl the gates will then open after Now you need to skulk to the end of the maze without being spotted by the shadows and if you are spotted you ll immediately be transported to where the Sacrificial Bowl is Using an invisibility spell and turn base mode works well But be careful of the traps You need to find Soft Step Key on the table of a hidden room or use lockpick to open the final gate Alternatively you can use Dimension Door spell to bypass this trial Once you ve made it inside the gate retrieve the Umbral Gem to complete the trial You can then interact with the Umbral Transporter to transport you back to where the Sacrifical Bowl is and exit the room Continue heading north and you ll find the Self Same Trial here X 763 Y 733 This trial forces you to fight a clone of your parties If you wish to make the combat encounter easier for you get naked and remove your armor and weapons before you offer your blood to the Sacrificial Bowl You can just re equip them before you enter the room The clone team has the ability to dip in and out of the shadows For this trial you would also need to take note of the Cheater s Folly condition if any member of your party attacks the enemy team that s not their own clone all their Ability Scores will be reduced by 1 and this effect can stack So it s recommended that you only attack your own clown if possible so you won t get stacked with debuffs If you ever get the Cheater s Folly inflicted on one of your party members simply killing the clone will remove that debuff Once you ve slain the enemy team you can loot the Umbral Gem from the last clone you killed You will also find a very rare ring called the Killer s Sweetheart Just like before you can use the Umbral Transporter to transport you back to where you came from to exit the area The last and final trial the Faith Leap Trial can be located downstairs X 744 Y 728 For this trial the room will be plunged into darkness after you offered the blood and you need to remember the location of the platforms to reach the Umbral Gem However you can use the Daylight spell to light the entire room or use Fly or Dimension Door spell to reach the final platform Once you reach the final platform retrieve the Umbral Gem and transport yourself to where you started and exit the area Once you ve completed the trials continue heading south and at this location X 756 Y 753 is the Silent Library You ll notice there s a white barrier at the entrance you can go through but you will be Silenced and you ll be unable to cast any spells There will be several Justiciar enemies in the area if you want to avoid combat you can try to sneak attack them with ranged attacks They don t seem to get triggered by getting damaged which will make this section easier Once you ve slain all the enemies in the area press the button on the far right corner of the room X 778 Y 751 to unlock the gate to the Treasure Room Once you enter the room disarm all of the traps first then look for the book called Teachings of Loss The Nightsinger then interact with the plinth and place the book After placing the book the door to Treasure Room will be opened Inside you ll find the Dark Justiciar Helmet Dark Justiciar Half Plate and the weapon to kill the Nightsong Spear of Night Once you retrieve the weapons loot whatever you can inside and exit the room While exploring the area you find lots of Rats Try talking to them and you can find they are not natural Use the Cragged Rock between the 2nd and 3rd trials to reach the feet of the giant Shar Statue Here you can find a Broken Effigy and a book read the book and talk to the rat to learn his story another victim of Raphael and the last remaining Dark Justiciar The rat will also reveal the location of Sharrn Provisions if you agree to spare him If you want to side with Yurgir you can kill the rats and the last Justiciar Doing so can avoid a fight with Yurgir And later easier to get his help when you sneak into Raphael s House of Hope and confront the archdevil Yurgir is also a potential ally in Gather Your Allies But you can still persuade Yurgir to join you even if you killed him here Alternatively if you chose to help the Orthon break his contract you learn more about the trickery of Raphael after killing the rat swarm at this location Now make your way back to the Pedestal of Reckoning at this location X 717 Y 776 Interact with the pedestal and you will have a short conversation with Shadowheart After your conversation get on top of the platform and interact with the Traversal Gem to reach the Inner Sanctum Once you ve been transported down interact with the Ancient Altar and place three Umbral Gems you ve collected to unlock the door ahead If anyone in your party has a background of Guild Artisan they will be inspired and you will also achieve Guild Artisan Dark Machinations head down the stairs and you ll discover the Verge of the Shadows waypoint at this location X 717 Y 842 Interact with the Shadowfell Entrance pool to trigger a dialogue with Shadowheart She says she needs to pray and tells you that everyone made it this far because of Lady Shar s grace If you try to peer into her mind while she s praying she will disapprove of this action You can gain an approval back from her after she says that Lady Shar only demands one sacrifice and you choose the option All right Fine Let s move on A prompt will then appear on the screen asking you if you want to proceed depending on your choices the state of the region could change and some active quests may become unavailable If you choose yes your character will step into the pool you will be transported to Nightson s Prison Once you ve been transported to the area continue heading northwest you ll need to make multiple jumps to reach the objective area You don t need to worry about fall damage as the gravity in this plane is adjusted You ll also notice Justiciar Soulhunters along the way as long as you don t attack them they won t turn hostile Once you reach this location X 606 Y 1435 you ll find Nightsong If you are able to convince Shadowheart to spare Nightsong you will gain an approval from Karlach and receive the Moonlight Glaive weapon NOTE There are 2 versions of this walkthrough that will affect the outcome of your relationship with one of the companions We recommend following the version indicated here but you may view the alternate version in the Moonrise Towers guide The first guide will feature infiltrating the Moonrise Towers and playing along as a faithful warrior to The Absolute only to betray them once you discover that Nightsong is the relic that Ketheric Thorm was referring to Shadowheart will abandon her duty to Lady Shar by freeing the Nightsong instead of killing her In order to reach the Moonrise Towers you will be traveling in the Shadow Cursed Lands where you will meet different characters of different races At exactly X 156 Y 97 you will see a bridge with glowing lights coming from the ground underneath There s also a Waypoint that you can unlock here Walk towards the bridge where 2 guards will stop you at the foot of the stairs The other one named Zealot Malik will recognize you as True Soul and will begin to act more friendly towards you Given their friendly nature it s recommended to avoid combat unless necessary here and thus choosing the first option will prompt them to give you information on what s going on inside The other guard Adept Merim tells you that Z rell is waiting in the audience chamber whom she thinks will be wanting to hear from you There are ghouls patrolling on the sides of the entrance but they are not hostile and you can just walk up the stairs to enter the tower Interact with the Heavy Oak Doors and continue to walk towards the center of the tower where you will be welcomed by Zealot Brinn You will notice that there s a Scrying Eye roaming in this area so be careful not to do anything suspicious that will raise their alarms Explore the Main Floor and go to exactly X 128 Y 193 you will find a trader named Araj Oblodra who will also notice Astarion and refer to him as a pale companion She continues to tell you that she trades blood and creates potions out of them She will brew a potent potion for you and then she will keep the rest She goes on to tell you that the potion will be unique to you one that contains your blood essence and The Absolute s blessing intertwined You find out that she keeps the blood for research and does a little bit of experimentation with it Next you can decide if you want to go on with brewing a potion If you agree she will extract blood from you and then as she collects it she will turn her attention to one of your companions Astarion to be specific She mentions that he s a vampire and by this Astarion responds that he won t bite as they are all friends under The Absolute However Araj Oblodra will respond with Oh I prefer if you did and then asks you a question I assume he belongs to you Choosing the first option here will gain Astarion and Karlach s approvals Then Araj will turn her attention to Astarion and she tells him that she has always dreamed of being bitten by a vampire She offers to give you a potion that will increase your strength permanently if you let Astarion bite her However Astarion will refuse her and will instead ask for your help to decide on this matter You will have 3 options If you force Astarion to do this he will disapprove of this however you will gain 2 potions One is unique to your character during our playthrough we got the Elixir of Dragonborn Prowess Fire Then for the other potion Potion of Everlasting Vigour which increases your Strength by 2 permanently You may also interact with Araj Oblodra again to check her wares She s also a trader dealing in Moonrise Towers After you encounter the trader in blood you can continue to explore the Main Floor of the Moonrise Towers and head to X 152 Y 200 where you will find Ketheric Thorm sitting on his throne and his audience The lives of Fezzerk and his group are being decided upon by Z rell Allow things to unfold before you so Ketheric Thorm will turn his attention to you and will ask for your judgment Then tell him to be kind to these soldiers If you choose the first one Ketheric Thorm will disagree saying that he can t afford more mistakes He will order the goblins to be killed but one of the unbelievers the one unaffected by the parasite will throw a spear into Thorm s chest in an attempt to kill him However it seems that Thorm is unaffected by this and kills the goblin swiftly Fezzerk s fate will be handed over to you and you are free to decide on how you want to deal with them If you show mercy on the goblins Astarion will disapprove of this Continue to go around the Main Floor of Moonrise Towers and you will find Lann Tarv who will have a dialogue with Karlach An old friend of hers named Flo wishes to hand over three Soul Coins to her These soul coins can come in handy but you also consider that it s dangerous to accept any offers from a Cambion If you reject this Karlach will give you a disapproval After that you may also check Lann Tarv s wares who is also a trader Also Roah Moonglow another trader is also stationed here You will come across Mig a troll who tells you about meat sounds She suspects that it s as big as the whole tower and can be heard loudest from the kitchen With this you head to the Kitchen located at X 112 Y 197 You will find Linsella among gnolls that seem tame enough to listen to her As you talk to her you will find out that she was able to control them with the power of The Absolute granted to her putting the beasts under her control As she demonstrates her power the gnoll will try to break free from her Your character will get an option to intervene or not As Linsella tries to demonstrate how she can control the gnoll that she calls Barnabus he will be free from her control and attacks her as Now in the face of a gnoll use the Persuasion check on it so that the gnoll will not attack you if you are successful This event called Pied Piper will inspire Astarion where you will successfully influence gnolls either to break free or continue being subservient Following the meat sounds that the troll mentioned earlier you will arrive at X 127 Y 175 You will find some sort of mucus blocking a doorway Given its current state your party won t be able to enter and investigate from here At X 144 Y 210 you will find yourselves on a landing that will take you to the First Floor of Moonrise Towers There s a bigger journey awaiting your party here and the first thing that you will witness here is Z rell and Radija in a conversation that no one is allowed to disturb the prayers of Thorm She will turn her attention to you and ask about how you handled the goblins Given that you let the goblins walk free in this walkthrough she will discover the act that you have done after reading your mind Redeem yourself by any means without provoking her into a fight and if successful she will go through again your mind to discover your wants and hopes This however has a bigger reason for why she s doing it as she s questioning your faith Choosing any of the checks will require you to pass a DC of 14 when successful she shares her story of how the Absolute gave her everything she wanted which is freedom She gives you a mission and then you hear the voice of the dream visitor inside your head They urge you to play along so you can get closer to the general and so you ll be able to find the answers you seek She tells you that General Thorm needs a relic that is currently located at the mausoleum beneath the tower She asks you to make contact with Disciple Balthazar and retrieve the relic To reach Balthazar s room you will head to the first floor where you will see Glourik standing watch by the door at X 133 Y 187 With Balthazar s room key you can explore his room and pick up the Moon Lantern which you will be needing as you explore the Mausoleum later on You will notice that there s a locked Metal Door within his room and attempting to unlock this will require passing a Dexterity check DC of 30 Inside the room you will find an undead hound guarding the area You can attempt an Animal Handling Performance or Intimidation check that will require you to pass a DC of 18 Once successful you can now freely roam the area without fighting the hound There are more chests that you can unlock in this area as well and pick up valuable items such as elixirs and scrolls There s another locked door here that will lead to a different room Unlocking this door will require you to pass a DC of 15 Inside this room you will find more chests to loot and letters to discover The unique chest can be found at the foot of the bed where it transforms into a Mimic the moment you get near it When you re done killing it you can loot its items NOTE It is important to finish the quests in the Moonrise Towers Prison before attacking Moonrise Towers because you will risk some of the quests becoming unavailable When you re done exploring the Main Floor and First Floor you can now go to the Prison located beneath the tower You will find a stair leading to this area at X 175 Y 193 Interact with the stairs here and this will take you to the Moonrise Towers Prison If you still have a good relationship with the cultists or haven t started a fight with them the guards will let you in without a fight Make sure to explore each room here if you want to stock up on scrolls and elixirs You will also find barrels and chests that you can open As you head into the prison rooms you will find a Scrying Eye guarding With this sentinel you have to make sure not to do anything suspicious while it watches in that area You will find the Tiefling Lia standing at the prison cell with who you can engage in a conversation this however will be put to a stop by one of the guards watching forbidding you from speaking to them Use the Persuasion or Deception check on the guards so that you can freely speak with the prisoners Attempting the Persuasion check will require you to pass a DC of 14 You can continue talking to Lia and she tells you that the gnomes are up to something and they re working together Urging you to find these gnomes to talk to them Continue to go around the cells and you will find Wulbren who is curious about how you were able to order the guard successfully He wants to know what is your business with them You can offer to help him for free or for a fee When successful Wulbren will tell you about his plan which involves looking for tools He will ask for you to hand them anything that can break rocks and also make sure that no one will see you helping them He also tells you that the Warden robbed them of their tools and you can start looking from there Locating the Tieflings and Wulbren will update the quests for these characters in your journal You will find the Warden in their room at X 572 Y 655 and ask her questions about confiscated items to reveal that she is hiding these in the office above You may also attempt the Intelligence check which will require you to pass a DC of 13 this will reveal that levers behind her desk can open the doors of the cells and the larger lever is used to trigger the alarm With her back turned against you you can sneak to go up the ladder However there is a Scrying Eye in this area so it s not advisable to steal the tools under its watchful eyes The moment you get spotted she will confront you to explain yourself or the other option is to fight The Warden since this area is unseen from the area outside Make sure to destroy the Scrying Eye in this area so that the others will not be alerted After this you can now search the office where items are being stored Make sure to loot the Warden s body to retrieve the Spellcrux Amulet and the Moonrise Guard s Key from her The chests above are locked but you can unlock them by doing a Dexterity check which requires you to pass a DC of 14 16 which varies on the difficulty of the chests With The Warden gone you can free the tieflings and Wulbreg by interacting with the levers behind the desk However there are still guards nearby so this will commence a battle between them and your party It is best to take care of the nearby guards before handing them the tools so that they can escape through the tunnels Follow them through the tunnels by using the walls that they have broken through You will find a boat docked at X 572 Y 577 and their party will take their leave This will complete your quests Rescue Wulbren and Rescue the Tieflings Now that the prisoners have escaped Moonrise Towers you can continue investigating the prison You will find traces of the red mucus that you found in the kitchen at X 507 Y 617 there is a cragged rock that you can interact with that will take you to the Oubliette This event of reaching the bottom will inspire Karlach on Delving into the Deep Hook Horrors are roaming about in this area and these monsters are immediately hostile as soon as they see you There s not much to do here but continue on the quest given by Z rell which is to aid Balthazar in looking for the relic You will see some enemies gathered at a lower level of Oubliette but this area is still blocked and you will need to go back up to the towers and look for another entrance NOTE This is our recommended guide that will lead Shadowheart to forsake her duty to Lady Shar and free Nightsong from her prison Visit Moonrise Towers to see the alternate guide In order to defeat Ketheric Thorm you now realize that there s a power that makes him invulnerable Your investigation will lead you to travel to Gauntlet of Shar where you will continue to aid Balthazar at the request of Disciple Z rell At the Verge of the Shadows at X 718 Y 845 you will find a body of water that serves as the entrance to Shadowfell the domain of Lady Shar You will get a warning that the state of the region can change depending on your decisions such as quests becoming unavailable If you proceed to do so we recommend following our guide to get your desired outcome As you step forward into the statue and through the body of water you will feel your body struggle as you fight back the sensation Your character will get knocked out together with your party Once you come back to your senses you will find yourselves in Shadowfell and Shadowheart immediately recognizes the presence of Lady Shar However you will be interrupted as Balthazar flies in to tell you to hurry along and become a witness to his work Shadowheart defies him and quickly tells him that he does not belong in the Dark Lady s domain You will now get the following options to respond In this area Balthazar has no desire to fight even if you choose the 4th one He will ask that you follow him as he leads the way into Nightsong s Prison Your party will be doing a series of jumps until you make it to the bottom of Shadowfell The pattern shouldn t be difficult and each member is guaranteed to survive the jumps as long as it s near the ledge and not falling off the rocks Once you finally catch up with Balthazar you realize that the relic that Discipe Z rell was referring to was the Nightsong which is in fact a humanoid She invites you to heap more sins upon your head My retribution will be all the sweeter for them Nightsong continues to reveal that she supplies Ketheric Thorm s immortality with her own soul Balthazar calls her Aylin and commands you to keep back to secure her for a journey You will now get the following options to respond If you choose the first one Balthazar tells you that she is more than that He shares that she possesses immortal strength and lends it to General Throm through his work After realizing that she is the key to Ketheric Thorm s immortality you will now have the option to save her or let Balthazar do his job If you choose the first option Karlach will give you her approval and you will begin to fight Balthazar right after Take note that this area is surrounded by Balthazar s minions and they will have the advantage as they are in a higher position Plan well so you can survive this assault With Balthazar out of the picture the Nightsong addresses Shadowheart She possesses the power to free her or kill her Shadowheart will turn to you and tells

another chance to talk to her or sway her with the next choices Choose the 4th option which will then lead you to the next choices Next choose the 2nd option so Nightsong will once again interrupt your conversation with Shadowheart Nightsong reveals that she knows of the only memory that Shadowheart has The memory of her being hunted by wolves and yet Shadowheart still can t remember what she has lost Shadowheart still believes that she is meant to become the Lady Justiciar and you will get the next choices here If you attempt the Persuasion check you will need to pass a DC of 21 choosing the 3rd option will also get the same results and grant the approval of Karlach When successful she will procure the spear of Lady Shar and grips it tightly as if she s ready for anything that was to come and yet she throws away the spear abandoning her lifelong quest Shadowheart now fears that she will be disowned and she fears what will happen next to her Nightsong tells her that her fate is not fixed and to lay a friendly hand on her to fight the battle that has been awaiting her the one that will take your party to Ketheric Thorm back to Moonrise Towers Upon doing so she calls out to Moonmaiden Selune as power surges through her arm She declares that the Nightsong is no more and she transforms into an armored Dame Aylin She spreads out her wings and swings her mighty sword She addresses Shadowheart once again and urges that she was able to spurn her Dark Lady and may start to feel a stirring of the truth after what she has done Dame Aylin that there is a battle yet to be fought after being freed from her century long prison She will now ask Shadowheart Are you ready If you choose the first one she responds with To kill Ketheric Thorm and she will fly away to lead the assault in Moonrise Towers against Thorm s army Shadowheart asks that you leave Shadowfell already after what she has done and she doesn t want to be in her domain when her rage falls upon her Freeing the Nightsong will grant you Selune s blessing and a Moonlight Glaive As you travel through the portal Shadowheart goes out for a moment She tells you that she heard Lady Shar s voice after she defied her She has been abandoned by her goddess and allies Powerless she will now seek answers from Dame Aylin Afterward you now get the option to respond to Shadowheart as you please if you want to progress your romance with her With Dame Aylin leading the fight against Ketheric Thorm s army she will fly across the Shadow Cursed Lands and make her way to Moonrise Towers As for your party your travel will begin at the bridge of Moonrise Towers where Jaheira awaits at the foot of the stairs She tells you that she is the last one standing and asks if you will take the final steps together with her If you choose to have Jaheira on your side Karlach will give you her approval You will be leading the assault on Moonrise Towers and you will find Thorm s army waiting for you at the Main Floor You will battle Disciple Z rell Barnabus and the others Make sure to plan ahead so you come out victorious in this battle You will have temporary companions in this area like Jaheira and you can take full control of her temporarily After clearing the Main Floor Jaheira offers to stay behind as you go up the tower with your party and assist Dame Aylin She wants to make sure that no one will be able to cross and assist the battle against Thorm She tells you that the final audience with Ketheric Thorm awaits you There are still enemies awaiting on the First Floor that you must defeat on your way to reach Thorm Fight the disciples and eliminate them to find Thorm As you open the Ornate Door this will lead you to Moonrise Towers Rooftop where a weakened Ketheric Thorm stands before you He demands to know what you have done to him and you can try to reason persuade or intimidate Ketheric Thorm If you attempt the Persuasion check you will need to pass a DC of 10 Balthazar responds that there is no redemption for him He acknowledges that he has died a long time ago and he only intends to bring Isobel back After this you get another set of options to understand how Ketheric Thorm came to be Thorm will refuse to believe that he can still redeem himself because the Moonmaiden failed to intervene when his life was dismantled He acknowledges that a true soul like you has defeated him but the gods beat him first Offering to help Ketheric or by choosing the first option will get Karlach s approval but Aylin will interrupt your conversation and demands that Thorm fight You can try to tell Aylin that he has surrendered but Aylin refuses to believe your word and will continue the battle against him Thorm now realizes that he needs to use his power that can t be hidden anymore He offers you one last chance to bow or he will destroy both you and Dame Aylin He commands you to bow but it will be revealed that you have The Prism with you This angers Ketheric Thorm and the battle will now begin against Ketheric Thorm Your party will raise their weapons against Thorm and what s left of his army on the rooftop There s still quite a handful of them here and they are surrounding the area Make sure to plan accordingly and focus on defeating Thorm first Once you get Thorm s HP to 0 he will not be downed but instead he stands up once more and tells you that his Lord beckons him Dame Aylin will fly away and swoop down as if ready to end it all however Thorm has been keeping his trump card all this time A colossal tentacle swings upwards from the foot of the tower and attacks Dame Aylin she vanishes right before your eyes together with Thorm who was able to escape his fate for now There are still enemies left behind by Thorm make sure to eliminate them to focus on the task at hand When you re done fighting make sure to search the chest atop the throne where Ketheric Thorm was seated You will find Jaheira has followed you to the rooftop She tells you that she fears that the Nightsong has been captured again and that their next step is to follow it beneath the tower to find them You will get the following options to respond For the next dialogue you will get an option if you want Jaheira to follow you in battle If not she will stay behind and be on guard with her harpers After Thorm s escape the one way to reach them is to drop down the chasm created by the colossal tentacle You can camp just before you begin the next battle so you can replenish your health and spell slots of your party NOTE This walkthrough will feature an alternate version wherein one of your companions Gale gets an opportunity to end the control of the absolute as part of The Wizard of Waterdeep quest When he gets close enough to the elder brain he can cause himself to explode killing everything else around him We recommend following our initial guide here but we will still indicate the alternate version below Once your party has rested you can now interact with the Hollow Tower Once you do so you will get a prompt that will ask you if you will leap after Ketheric Thorm and the tentacle that drew him underground with the Nightsong If you agree your character will look down on the chasm as Shadowheart asks if you intend to jump down Seemingly as if your character didn t hear anything you will jump down the chasm and upon reaching the ground you see the walls around you are covered with the same red mucus that you found inside the tower from where the suspicious sounds came from The mucus is far thicker indicating that you are closer to the source You and your party have finally reached the Mind Flayer Colony and your Dream Visitor speaks to you that you are closer to the source of the parasites the ones that were used to infect your party Interact with the membrane that s blocking the path to destroy it and reveal new sub areas These membranes are surfaces that your character can interact with The dream visitor continues to speak again to remind you to be careful as you get closer to the source You will find Intellect Devourers in this area but they are not immediately hostile You will find them roaming around and seem to be running away from you Follow the passage down to your right to reach a Flesh Wrought Door that will reveal the Morgue sub area You will see rotting bodies and cages dumped nearly anywhere and if you were able to reach Oubliette while you were exploring Moonrise Towers Prison this was the area that can be seen from the central part On your right you will find a brain that is contained inside it if you did not destroy the brain in the Nautiloid Ship they will show up here in the Morgue sub area They will ask for your help to have them freed because it claims that they are not like the others and that they will be destroyed If you save them they can accompany you in battle in the form of a summon To reply you will get the following options There s also a console in the center of this area When you interact with it a corpse will fall through the hatch Chop speaks out that those are offering from Moonrise Towers Next you can speak with Chop a creature with a hollow mind that has been enslaved by The Absolute It seems that it is following orders but can t think much on its own You will now get a chance to choose how to interact with Chop You find out that Chop has been harvesting the brains of their captives while The Absolute turns them into Intellect Devourers and eventually they will become a part of the hivemind It also tells you that the brain inside the cage is different from the others and needs to be fixed Now you ll get the option if you want to free it or let him do his work If you attempt the Persuasion check you will need to pass a DC of 14 When you are successful he will hand you the key to free it Upon successfully freeing the brain you will receive an item Summon Us they tell you that they will remain with you until you call out to them Continue looking around this area and you will find helms on the table Check your party s equipment and see if any of the items are fit for them Your next destination is the Necrotic Laboratory which you will find at X 715 Y

them you will have a pile of bodies to loot from The area that they were standing from shows Profane Womb that can be attacked and destroyed Behind the ritual zone there is a secluded space behind it Jump over the ledge towards X 695 Y 110 to find Resonance Stone on the table Next to the table there s a Slack Skinned Head that speaks in incomplete sentences that seems to be lending the voice to the elder lore Next go to the other side of the laboratory where you can locate another console This one is in desperate need You will get an option if you want to help this console or not If you do you can get a weapon from this and understand the Grand Design built by the Illithids The Mind Flayer Colony Puzzle consists of four nodes to match the other end Follow this order to complete the puzzle You can now walk to the stony statue at the back of the puzzle where a voice will finally speak The Desecrated Relief tells you about The Grand Design and the words order perfection and unity The Dream Visitor speaks to you again to tell you that the Grand Design is the restoration of the Mind Flayer empire the dream of all Illithids After this cutscene look around in the ground and you will find the Blade of Oppressed Souls right next to the opening of the statue Continue exploring the path on your map and follow the guide to the Suspicious Sounds that is highlighted in a yellow ring At exactly X 686 and Y 13 you will see another Flesh Wrought Door This door will lead you to the Tadpoling Centre where you will find similar pods that were used to capture you in the Nautiloid ship You can interact with each of the consoles to find out about the prisoners that they once held There s a Neural Apparatus next to it that you can interact with You find out that there are Illithids and the not yet infected ones that are desperate for release It is your choice if you want to release or purge these creatures together with the non infected ones or let them be If you choose to release them Karlach will give you her approval while Astarion will give his disapproval Zevlor is inside one of the pods but freeing them means you will have to fight against the Mind Flayers that will be freed together with the rest of the prisoners By doing so the Intellect Devourer will also become hostile at the command of the Illithids Defeat the enemies here and speak with Zevlor after He is eager to find out what had become of his people and you can respond to him with one of the following options If you choose the third option he tells you that they were ambushed by the cultists and that he has heard a voice of a woman who whispered promises in his mind He realized that he was put under a charm and it was too late for the ones that he was supposed to be protecting He surrendered and even welcomed the Absolute he said After this he is aware of the battle that lies ahead and will offer his help He tells you that Ketheric is below and that he intends to look for other survivors and lead them out of the area Now it s up to you if you want Zevlor to fight with you or save his people Continue exploring the yellow ring and you will find Mizora at X 682 Y 37 in front of Brine Pools She speaks out loud that there are no more tadpoles and that it is an indicator that they are planning something big She had been captured by the Illithids and you have gained an opportunity to free Wyll from his pact with her If you attempt the History check you will need to pass a DC of 16 Then you will remember a chant that is used to void a devil s contract You will now get the next choices Mizora will laugh at you and she will agree to free Wyll but only after she s free from the pod Now you will turn your attention to the controls next to Mizora s pod The key here is the Right Device will free Mizora while the Left Device will kill her Note that Wyll s soul is still bound to her so if Mizora dies so does Wyll If you choose to free Mizora she reveals that she will only release Wyll s soul after six months and calls you an Ignorang thing Mizora will now leave this area and you can continue exploring the Mind Flayer Colony at exactly X 704 Y 24 you will find another Flesh Wrought Door that will lead you into the Barracks You will find a Kressa Bonedaughter in this area who suspects that you are part of the attackers You can attempt the Deception check here which requires you to pass a DC of 21 or simply attack her We recommend using the Deception check first and if that works you can have one of your party do a sneak attack on her The rest of the enemies will see what you have done and you will have fewer enemies to fight All that s left now is to eliminate Bonefighter Maghtew Badj and Hairy Henry Continue the path behind this section and you will find a Restoration that looks like a mushroom Interact with it to replenish your health In the distance below you will see a grand area that is separated from the Mind Flayer Colony which seems to be like a grand stage There s a Neural Apparatus that serves as a lift that will take you to the bottom of the Mind Flayer Colony Your party is moving closer to Ketheric Thorm and you can sense the Nautiloids stronger down here At X 812 Y 25 you will find another Flesh Wrought Door as you interact with it the Dream Visitor will speak to you that you have found the location of The

planning on taking back the Prism from you while they held the Nightsong captive You hear them that they will proceed with their plans and expect Ketheric with his army and weapon All three of them command The Absolute and the colossal elder brain floats from the water below They have infected Duke Ravengard with a tadpole and they leave at once to lead the march into the Baldur s Gate while leaving Ketheric behind You will find Ketheric at the edge of the Chasm proclaiming his worship for his Lord and he will fall to it as Myrkul will rise from below Apostle of Myrkul introduces himself as the Lord of Bones and you will now be fighting him Remember that Ketheric remains invulnerable as long as he has the Nightsong captured Your initial goal is to free Nightsong with the Help action as she is trapped inside a soul cage by Ketheric When you bring his HP to 0 Ketheric refuses to die and he returns to deliver his speech and ask for his Master s help He realizes that there is nothing but silence and that he has been forsaken He calls out to Isobel before he dies and Dame Aylin swoops down to crush his head repeatedly as the rest of your party watches in horror With Ketheric gone you will retrieve Netherstone from him the one they use to control the elder brain With that The Dream Visitor comes to tell you what has happened It s the three who were controlling the Elder Brain against its will or what they call The Absolute They continue to explain that the Netherstones are what s used to control the elder brain In order to gain full control you must collect the remaining Netherstones from Orin and Gortash They continue to reveal that The Absolute is a front of the Dead Three called Bane Bhaal and Myrkul Each of them has their own Chosen to take part in this attack on

room in the deepest level of Mind Flayer Colony As your party descends deeper into the Mind Flayer Colony your party will stop at a Flesh Wrought Door Just as you open the door the Dream Visitor speaks to you again that you have found the root of it all As you and your party prepare for a fight you sneak inside and see 3 figures in the middle of a conversation As the Dream Visitor speaks about the Elder Brain being the cruelest and most powerful creature in existence Gale who is standing behind you is in awe of so much power before him and how he wishes to hold it However he stops himself and says that he can t and must obey as his goddess commands You as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options If you choose the second option he will then respond to you One last gust of Weave One last gale to end them all The Dream Visitor will disagree but Gale unleashes the bomb within him the one that he s been keeping in check ever since your journey together began The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed The bomb took everything within its powerful radius however the remaining tadpoles that had survived will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations now that the control of the Absolute is gone Soon Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do

offers to help investigate in order to reveal the faceless Then he invites you to witness as he makes history as the first Archduke of Baldur s Gate You will get the following options to respond If you choose the second one Karlach will give you her disapproval while Astarion gives his approval Then Gortash kneels before Duke Ulder Ravengard and proceeds with the ceremony After the Duke is done with his words he will now ask the guests for consent and you will have the following options to respond If you choose the first one Gortash will now be appointed as the Archduke of Baldur s Gate When the ceremony is over Karlach will speak to you about how you let Gortash become Archduke and will ask what you think of him If you choose the first one Karlach will give you her approval and agrees that he has always had an expensive taste She continues to ask how anyone in the hall could fall for this charade Choosing the second here will anger Karlach even further and wished that people knew the truth about the Dead Three being behind all of this She wants the people to know that Gortash isn t their salvation but the very monster at the gate The rest of the audience leaves the hall but Duke Ulder Ravengard remains and gives you a chance at a conversation If you tell this man that he is infected with an Illithid parasite Astarion will approve of this Ravengard appears to be fighting the parasite but the control over him is strong You get the option to use your Illithid powers to explore his uncertainty If you attempt the Wisdom check you will need to pass a DC of 2 Then you can now look around the fortress You will find Mizora on the first floor back in the Audience Hall She has more things to tell you about the condition of Ravengard She reveals that he has been relocated and will only tell you in camp once you have Wyll in your party This will update Rescue the Grand Duke quest To explore the Prison return to the door that will take you outside There s a crack in the wall that you can interact with at exactly X 58 Y 189 Once inside jump over the ledge to reach the walls of the prison Destroy this wall with one of your attacks to gain entry to one of the storage rooms There s a chest inside so make sure to take a look before unlocking the door Unlocking the door will require you to do a Dexterity Check with a DC of 15 Be careful when opening the door because a Prison Guard is likely to spot you When this happens you can attempt a Deception check or attack Doing the former will require passing a DC of 15 If you re successful there s no need to attack the guard as he will simply let you through Continue on the path the guard is facing to reach the Prison Entrance Door Since you don t have the key you will need to unlock this door by lockpicking by doing a Dexterity Check which requires a DC of 20 You may also choose to fight the guards and obtain the key from them You will find a guard sleeping to your left upon unlocking the door Try not to make any sound to avoid waking them up or put them under a spell to guarantee that they will stay asleep This passage will lead you back to the Fortress where the others are waiting Description and

Gate 3 covers all possible conclusions to the game determined by the player s influence on the Forgotten Realms Each ending is shaped by the key decisions players made throughout the game s Main Quests and Side Quests How you respond to NPCs during dialogue how you resolve conflicts in key quests which Side Quests you choose to pick up and which you don t complete many choices you make in Baldur s Gate 3 will affect the ending you will get at the end This page covers each ending for the main story and every character and the requirements to reach each ending From an interview with one of Larian Studios lead writers it was revealed that Baldur s Gate 3 will have 17 000 ending variations on release That is not to say that there are thousands of unique main story endings however given the sheer number of variations there are it is safe to say that starting a new series of campaigns will lead to a new and fresh experience if you choose to play a different main character With the confirmed count of possible endings this can guarantee a high level of replayability to discover the multiple ways the game can end Of course not all of these endings are major however the way you play or interact with the characters in the realm will definitely have an impact on the story of Baldur s Gate 3 Consider some of the things listed below that can affect Endings in Baldur s Gate It is likely that players will not be able to reach multiple endings in a single playthrough of Baldur s Gate 3 The game s ending will be dictated by many key choices made throughout each story act and each choice made in earlier acts will influence what choices you have available to you in later acts Because of this it is not possible to simply make a save near the end of a playthrough then go back to said save state to view all the possible unique endings the game has to offer It will be possible to make saves before or at turning points in the game where you have to make key decisions though going back and replaying the game each time may prove tedious This page contains details of scenarios that will lead to specific endings Extremely detailed spoilers after this point Overall summary This ending is focused on the main character that will become a hero to save the fate of the realms Upon arriving at the foot of the Netherbrain your goal is to reach the top of it with your party In this area you will be battling thralls the Netherbrain s spawns in an attempt to slow your party Once you are successful at this battle the Netherbrain is weakened and will try to tempt you by offering you a choice to join and be The Absolute This ending can be obtained by making the decision of commanding the Netherbrain to destroy itself while you re atop it as you resist its temptations to join The Absolute This will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command and the fighting below in the city will cease The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire This ending is focused on the destruction of the Netherbrain through The Emperor This will happen upon trusting The Emperor to carry out the task Upon arriving at the foot of the Netherbrain your goal is to reach the top of it with your party In this area you will be battling thralls the Netherbrain s spawns in an attempt to slow your party Once you are successful at this battle the Netherbrain is weakened and will try to tempt The Emperor by offering him a choice to join and be The Absolute This will then prompt a choice for your character who might see this as an opportunity This ending can be obtained by making the decision of commanding the Netherbrain to destroy itself while you re atop it as The Emperor resists its temptations to join The Absolute This will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command and the fighting below in the city will cease The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire Choosing the other two options will result in different endings This ending is the opposite of commanding the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself where you will make the second choice You will succumb to your hunger for power and dominion and accept the offer of The Netherbrain to become The Absolute You will be prompted to make a decision between two choices You will get this ending by choosing the second option Your companions will try and stop you from becoming but your decision is firm to become The Absolute Evil will persist across the realms under your rule This ending is the opposite of commanding the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself where you will make the second choice You will succumb to your hunger for power and dominion and seize the weakness that you see in The Emperor as he battles the temptation presented by The Absolute You will get this ending by choosing the second option Your companions will try and stop you from becoming but your decision is firm to become The Absolute Evil will persist across the realms under your rule This ending is the opposite of

The Absolute Evil will persist across the realms under your rule This ending is specific to The Dark Urge origin where you will claim The Absolute in the name of Bhaal While working with The Emperor he will come face to face with The Absolute as it tempts him to work with him and become the Absolute The Emperor is fighting it off with all his strength and you see this as an opportunity to betray him As a child of Bhaal you remember the destiny promised by your Father and feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal s anguish so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal Kill the Emperor This ending is specific to The Dark Urge As a descendant of Bhaal you will be forced to face one of his minions by the name of Orin Upon winning this battle Bhaal will take form and present himself to you Bhaal begins to acknowledge you as his chosen and thus he will offer you a gift to use and lacerate

world in his name When you are facing the Emperor he will offer you to accept the tadpole and allow it to transform you He tells you that he has been keeping a tadpole and nurturing it just for you He tells you to open your mind to the parasite and allow it to give you power Accepting this will turn you into a Mind Flayer and will allow you to work hand in hand with the Emperor and you will be able to defeat the Netherbrain together You will fully trust The Emperor as you take on the fight Atop the Netherbrain where you will be battling the spawns of The Absolute When the time comes that The Absolute will try to tempt you to become The Absolute you will resist this by commanding it to destroy the tadpoles and then itself There is another known variation of how you can turn yourself to become a Mind Flayer This is by helping to free Orpheus the Prince of the Githyanki At first The Emperor will ask you to release the Netherstones to him If you reject him here he will leave the area Once the Prince is freed he will offer himself to become Illithid but you will be given two choices listed below Choosing the second option here will turn you into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design That will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself A good natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself and later on you will have the desire to explore the world and not rule it even as a mindflayer This will also unlock the achievement of Ceremorphosis endingdescription endingdescription This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions Gale He has a shared and deep history with Mystra the Goddess that he once served You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin Ketheric Thorm Lord Enver Gortash who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain Upon seeing this Gale is in awe of

now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations Soon Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect The narrator continues It is an ending of sorts

until he was snatched away Now he can walk in the light but can he leave his wicked past behind APPROVAL UP All Astarion Approval Up Choices APPROVAL DOWN All Astarion Approval Down Choices Astarion can be found southwest of the Roadside Cliff by the Nautiloid shipwreck on the beach To learn more about Astarion please visit his page by clicking here Players need to be deceptive clever and uncaring of other people s problems being mean to people as well as taking advantage of them will gain approval from Astarion as he enjoys being above people It will take some time and story progression to get his approval but players will need to make sure to make decisions that Astarion will like you for Once at the campsite Astarion will try to influence his opinion of you if there is a good relationship If not he will not be interested in you Players will need to be at the campsite after rescuing the Druid Halsin as well as completing the side quest to save the refugees then take a long rest Upon completing this a celebration for the refugees will be held players can take this time to go over to Astarion and romance him players will have to follow these dialog choices Head to a bedroll and interact with it to get the decision to go to bed alone or with Astarion Players will need to follow these dialog choices Completing this dialog will lead to a passionate night with Astarion Players will see the Under Construction screen as well as some moments of talking ASTARION BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS ASTARION BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS A High Half Elf Trickster Domain Cleric and one of Shar s dark disciples Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power While wrestling with her faith and strange untamed magic Shadowheart has enemies on all sides and a long buried secret to uncover APPROVAL UP All Shadowheart Approval Up Choices APPROVAL DOWN All Shadowheart Approval Down Choices NOTE Upon discovering a damaged helmet on a body in the Blighted Village and passing a few skill checks in dialogue with Shadowheart you can get her to reveal her worship of Shar After this the following dialogue option can be repeated in camp to gain infinite approval increase Other Approval Down Choices Shadowheart can be found trapped in a pod aboard the Mind Flayer Nautiloid If she is not freed she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt Abandoned Ruins at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach To learn more about Shadowheart please visit her page by clicking here Players will need to get Shadowheart s approval by successfully avoiding conflict or having them result in a peaceful solution when confronted even through questionable means like thievery scam or even extortion As long as you use your wit and cunning for anything justifiable you should earn yourself approval from her Shadowheart also has a rivalry with Lae zel so going against Lae zel and supporting Shadowheart whenever the choice presents itself will also raise her approval of you However this obviously goes against Lae zel s approval as well so players will have to be wary of that Being successful with Persuasion Deception Religion and Insight checks will grant you her approval as well as long as she s in your current party SHADOWHEART APPROVAL EXPLOIT Upon discovering a damaged helmet on a body in the Blighted Village and passing a few skill checks in dialogue with Shadowheart you can get her to reveal her worship of Shar After this the following dialogue option can be repeated in camp to gain infinite approval increase Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees unlike how it was in Early Access Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up players may approach her at the camp for a talk At this point your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up if it s still lacking at this point You re on the right track with Shadowheart if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says I can t help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect Truly connect when they talk to her This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone Afterward head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart By clicking on Shadowheart players share a moment with her at the cliffside You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her but still keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path When she asks you about yourself the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it When she tries to share about herself but says she can t she ll appreciate it if you don t pry further As previously mentioned anything you ve managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices Eventually you both will lie down on the rocks and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship Shadowheart BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS Shadowheart BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS A Human Wizard Gale has one ambition to become the greatest wizard Faerun has ever known Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest counting down to an explosion that can level a city Gale is confident he ll overcome it but time is not on his side APPROVAL UP All Gale Approval Up Choices APPROVAL DOWN All Gale Approval Down Choices Players can find Gale right after the prologue at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint located just above the Nautilus shipwreck To learn more about Gale please visit his page by clicking here Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game s early stages making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior particularly morally questionable actions which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough you d be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway Offering consumable artifacts as per his condition and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval As a master of magic Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent brute force approaches a trait he shares with Shadowheart as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts science and poetry As a Human he subscribes to a more general sense of morality so acts of kindness will also gain his approval Conversely one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence displaying stupidity lacking curiosity or passing judgment on his condition or other people with similar circumstances Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees unlike how it was in Early Access Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up players may approach him at the camp for a talk At this point your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up if it s still lacking at this point Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him and might even come up in your dialogues For example making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you You re on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head as he s staring at a hologram he s producing at the palm of his hand He won t really get into who the hologram was of but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave Naturally it ll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in Naturally it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that ll make the experience come to a halt Eventually you ll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to through your connection to the Weave Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him Nothing will happen yet but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them When you talk to him next ask him what he thought of what you had pictured Unlike some of the other Companions this doesn t start your official relationship with him per se but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it Gale BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS Gale BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS Lae zel is a consummate Fighter ferocious even by the standards of a Githyanki creche Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy Lae zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people if they do not execute her first APPROVAL UP All Lae zel Approval Up Choices APPROVAL DOWN All Lae zel Approval Down Choices Players can find Lae zel on the Nautiloid ship during the prologue and is the first companion member you recruit to help with your escape However once the prologue is complete she will leave Players can find her on Revenge Beach north of the Roadside Cliffs To learn more about Lae zel please visit her page by clicking here Players will have to make tougher more aggressive decisions and dialog choices as Lae zel isn t a very sympathetic or sentimental person Before romancing Lae zel players will need to make sure to be as chaotic as she is as she is only on the journey for her own interests and is not willing to make stops for others Lae zel s personality can be described as loud direct and bloodthirsty She doesn t hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives even if it was to avoid bloodshed to avoid getting sidetracked For her it s crucial that she handles all Githyanki related matters her way and she has pride in her race and their standing She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences though they occasionally find common ground This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval while the opposite will always win approval from her To gain Lae zel s approval one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas For example she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem In general whenever any chances to agree with pro Githyanki statements present themselves you should take it if you want to get on her good side It can be viewed that she values duty above all else and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness something she might share with Astarion especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer Gaining approval from Lae zel can be more challenging than other Companions as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good As such players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae zel away from certain dialogues either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance Your relationship with Lae zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees unlike how it was in Early Access Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval high enough players may approach her at the camp for a talk At this point your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up if it s still lacking at this point You re on the right track with Lae zel if when you talk to her at the camp after yet another remark about the Githyank method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem rather than the Druid Halsin s depending on where you are in Act I you ll have the option to flirtingly ask her if she s been looking at you differently of late She ll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light She ll openly say that she wants you After this dialogue you ll just have to rest at your bunker Lae zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter Try to keep an open mind Lae zel BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS Lae zel BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS A Human Warlock and Noble by birth Wyll made his name as the heroic Blade of Frontiers He keeps his pact with a devil well hidden and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal APPROVAL UP All Wyll Approval Up Choices APPROVAL DOWN All Wyll Approval Down Choices Players can find Wyll during chapter one in the Remove the Parasite quest You will be able to recruit him after the battle against Goblins at the gates of the encampment To learn more about Wyll please visit his page by clicking here Normally players will need to make conversation and do the right actions to gain approval with their companions however it is a bit tricky with Wyll He is noble and admires when players chooses to be heroic lending a helping hand as well as going against selfishness entitled behavior and never siding with monsters such as Devils and Goblins Players will need to speak to Wyll back at the camp and ask him about the Goblins and the Tieflings doing so gets Wyll to open up about why he dislikes Goblins so much When asked about Wylls glass eye he decides not to share this because he does not know the player well enough to open up about it Later on players will need to choose not to bring him along to the goblin camp or the windmill in the Blighted Village doing either of these will trigger Wyll to talk about his past and his glass eye At this point players may not have access to romance him yet Instead take Wyll out of your party and head over to the Blighted Village Head over to the windmill speak with Spike and pursuade him into giving the prisoner that is strapped onto the windmill to the player Do not torture him but release him instead Head back to the campsite and add Wyll back into the party then head to the Goblin Camp Look for Spike and speak about Mizora players will need to kill Spike and Abdirak when he says that Mizora is no longer there End the day here and speak with Wyll back at the campsite Wyll will then open up about Mizora Go to bed after this conversation Head back to the Goblin Camp and speak with Halsin in their prison hunt down all of the Goblin leaders while Wyll is still in your party This gives the option of Romancing Wyll later on Wyll BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS Wyll BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS Karlach is a Barbarian Tiefling that was sold young to an Archdevil in order to fight in the blood wars the never ending battle that rages on in the nine hells Now that she is free she seeks revenge on the one who sold her in the first place APPROVAL UP All Karlach Approval Up Choices APPROVAL DOWN All Karlach Approval Down Choices Players can find Karlach at The Risen Road in the side quest Hunt the Devil To learn more about Karlack please visit her page by clicking here As of now players can raise Karlach s approval by showing their strength to her as well as freeing slaves as she was once enslaved when she was younger Gaining Karlach s approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae Zel Additionally her context as someone who just escaped the Hells makes attunes her towards people who do actions that express their love of life and being outgoing As with all the Companions whenever you can talk to Karlach always scour the dialogue options for any new options again still following the general guidelines above where she ll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another She ll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you so you only need to be the same Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees unlike how it was in Early Access Keeping the general guidelines in mind above and eventually getting her approval high enough players may approach her at the camp for a talk At this point your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up if it s still lacking at this point One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon Eventually this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem Afterward use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss It s important to note that while it might not be a certainty this might count as an attempt at romance already and so while your relationship hasn t officially started by any means it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions To romance Karlach players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her As mentioned previously she will have no pretense about responding to your affections Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her Afterward head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach By clicking on Karlach players share a moment with her right there on their bunk You ll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she ll stop you for fear of hurting you further As previously mentioned just keep being forward with her about your feelings and don t be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense yearning relationship with her Karlach BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS Karlach BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS Minthara is a ruthless Drow that is preparing an assault on Druid Grove She can be found at Shattered Sanctum APPROVAL UP All Minthara Approval Up Choices During the following cutscene you have to choose APPROVAL DOWN All Minthara Approval Down Choices Minthara can first be found in Act I within the Shattered Sanctum inside the Goblin Camp as one of the three Goblin leaders Siding with her allows the opening of the branching storyline that allows Tav to side with the Goblins and start the Quest Raid the Grove which may lead to recruiting her in Act II In Act II she will be on trial and eventually under torture in the Moonrise Towers Rescuing her there will allow you to officially recruit her as a Companion Otherwise siding with the Tieflings and killing the goblins will have you kill Minthara as well The same result will come from siding with her first and successfully initiating an intimate night with her and then failing to convince her of your shared affiliation with the Absolute later on Both routes will lock you out of recruiting or romancing Minthara Approval Guide for Minthara goes here When you first meet her in the Shattered Sanctum you have the option to betray the Druids and the Tieflings and side with Minthara instead as a fellow True Soul for the Absolute Just click the appropriate responses that go toward deciding to help her As per the plan you ll go back to the Grove and pretend to still be on the side of the Tieflings When Minthara and her army arrive she ll give you the telepathic signal to open the gate and begin a combat engagement to slaughter the Tieflings To get the early romance scene with Minthara you ll just have to speak with her and affirm the start of your would be relationship and express to her that you re ready to be hers Afterward head to your bed roll The scene will automatically initiate when you rest When it ends you ll have the option to telepathically pry into her desires or her fears In the Early Access trying for her fears and succeeding will lead to undesirable results but it is not certain currently if this remains to be the case in the full game She will share her thoughts all the same if you choose to pry into her desires and will explain that she cannot hear the Absolute when she is with you You have the option to spill the secret about Shadowheart s artifact if you d like but it may have certain ramifications later on When she lets you go you ll actually get to rest but only until she attempts to murder you in your sleep Suffice it to say unlike other Companions this whole encounter doesn t spell the start of your relationship The important dialogue option here will be when you ll either try to persuade or deceive her with the relevant checks to convince her that you are allied with her under the Absolute Doing anything else other than those two will result in her betrayal and you ll be forced to kill her in a combat engagement locking you out of being able to recruit her much less romance her Act II will eventually bring you to the Moonrise Towers during the Quest Infiltrate the Moonrise Towers Inside the towers you ll be able to find Minthara being mentally tortured to the point of erasure The dialogue options will allow you to either do an Intimidation check or a Deception check so that they can leave Minthara s punishment to you instead If successful you can make a Wisdom check to try and telepathically reach her Note that at any point you can choose to instead go for a brute force approach and try to kill her captors instead Once you reach her you ll have the same choice of propositions to offer her If you choose to try the more peaceful approach you ll have to make either an Intimidation Deception or Persuasion check to fool the Questioners and you ll have to keep this up for any other characters you ll bump into or you ll have to engage them in battle until you exit Moonrise There you ll have the option to let her in on everything you ve learned so far as well as the location of your camp From then on you can bring her along as an official Companion and raise her approval of you Minthara BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS Minthara BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS Halsin can be found as a prisoner at the Worg Pens deep within the Shattered Sanctum Halsin is the first Druid of the Druid Grove but has been missing since he left with Aradin s expetidition APPROVAL UP All Halsin Approval Up Choices APPROVAL DOWN All Halsin Approval Down Choices You learn about Halsin for the first time at the Druid Grove He has gone with Aradin s expedition to the Goblin Camp but he never managed to return because he was captured He can be found at the Worg Pens If you free him he offers to join you during the raid of the goblin camp Doing this he will be at your side but every NPC that crosses your path will be automatically hostile If you raze the Goblin Camp and kill the three goblin leaders True Soul Gut Dror Ragzlin and Minthara before talking to him at the Worg pens you will find Halsin has left his cage and has returned to the Druid Grove by himself After introducing himself he thanks you for your actions and immediately senses you have a problem he can help you with After the events at the Shattered Sanctum Halsin will then return to the Druid Grove If you have exposed Kagha he will be having a word with her Once the Tiefling party is over he will tell you about Moonrise Towers Halsin is different compared to other companions as he cannot be recruited as a party member until Act II though you are able to flirt with him already after you first meet him in Act I during the Quest Save the Refugees or Find the Druid As you go through Act II you ll eventually make it to the Last Light Inn Certain situations may trigger the devastation of the inn especially if you chose to play as The Dark Urge so make sure to choose the options that will preserve everything and everyone as much as possible Making sure to keep the inn intact leads to encountering someone there called the Sleeping man Speaking with him prompts a Quest from Halsin to find Thaniel a child he seeks This Quest will eventually entail protecting Halsin as he attempts to travel inter dimensionally This can be a difficult fight as you ll have to keep him alive in a difficult combat engagement until he finishes his task Successfully clearing the quest will reward you with finally being able to officially recruit Halsin and thus make him available for romance Make sure to keep clearing out any other Quests surrounding Halsin as you build approval with him When you get your approval with Halsin enough as an official Companion you can talk to him at camp with the exclamation point over his head for his intimate scene Follow the conversation with affirming dialogue options until he mentions having many previous lovers Ask him what exactly he means by this to get his direct confession If you were holding out all this time for Halsin you ll simply need to assure him that you reciprocate his feelings Otherwise you ll have to be honest about it and say that you re interested but you re already with somebody else He will explain that he does not mind sharing you as he sees romance and partnership as a fluid system much like nature to which he is so attuned As a good partner who respects their lover you ll have to go and have a talk with your current partner and see how they feel about polyamory Astarion Karlach and Shadowheart have been confirmed to not mind Naturally if they do mind and if you mind yourself you can choose to break it off with them and exclusively be with Halsin After you get their permission head back promptly to Halsin and let him know to initiate the famous love scene When he loses control and turns into a bear you ll have the option to choose whether or not you d like him to continue the deed in human form or as a bear No one will judge you as long as you both are happy Halsin BG3 IMPORTANT

to top Subclasses in Baldur s Gate 3 is a secondary classification that players can choose apart from the main Class Subclasses determine your character s Abilities aptitudes and how they will develop as they increase in level Each available class in the game will split into a number of subclasses Most Classes will have three available Subclass options while others like the Cleric and Wizard will have more This page covers a list of all the subclasses available in the game The table also lists the ones that can be played during Early Access Upon the official release of Baldur s Gate 3 players will be able to see all 12 Classes which expands to about 46 Subclasses during Character Creation including the new subclasses and the new Monk class Developers have announced that they have added at least one new Subclass per Class so that players will have additional options and a chance to have a new experience On average one class will have about 3 subclasses but other specific Classes may have more to try out such as the Cleric and the Wizard Baldur s Gate 3 also introduces the Multiclassing feature that will be available at release After selecting a Class in the Subclass menu players can proceed to view all Subclasses related to that Class Select one to view the Subclass description the associated Actions and Subclass Features before proceeding to the next step which is to choose your Background Each Class will have an average of 3 available subclasses while others may have more Each Class in Baldur s Gate 3 comes with unique interactions because of their special abilities and personalities These are also then divided into different subclasses which also differ in combat playstyle skills and strengths Each subclass per Class will have complex distinct characteristics and interactions depending on the combination you proceed with during Character Creation Developers even pointed out that Paladins no longer have to portray a loyal noble knight depending on the selected subclass but instead be driven by revenge which shows the contrasting characteristics of each subclass even when they are from the same Class This could open up new unique quests dialogues interactions combat animations and experiences based on your chosen Class and Subclass as well as your chosen Background and Race Nearing the new official pushed up release date of Baldur s Gate 3 developers wanted to make sure that players from every preferred Class will have a new Subclass to experience Below are the latest Subclasses and their corresponding Classes that were added to the roster before the official release in addition the ones available during Early Access Since the official class roster release the Monk has since been added to the available Classes in Baldur s Gate 3 This comes with 3 new Subclasses each with varying traits and characteristics that provide different interpretations of what a Monk is The Monk and all three subclass pages can now be found with the rest of the subclassess below including the Way of the Open Hand Way of Shadow and Way of the Four Elements This class has been introduced as A master of martial arts harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection This is displayed through the different combat methods of the different subclasses which will feature elemental abilities and spells ninja like martial art combat and psychic blast abilites Multiclassing is a feature that was not previously implemented in Early Access but was announced during a showcase just before the official release of the game Players will now be able to meet a character in game that can assist with switching classes mid game This will allow players to redistribute their levels without restarting the game and undergoing Character Creation Requirements for players to use this feature have been removed and they no longer have to reach a 13 Ability Score as seen in the DnD 5e Players are encouraged to try different combinations and Classes to find a Build that best suits them to create a fun and enjoyable experience This is done through the same NPC that is met in early act 1 who will have a few helpful abilities including the ability to restart your Build with new starting proficiencies attributes spells and cantrips Quick Search of All Subclasses Gotta love how the wizard and cleric get the most

Shapeshift Level 1 Illusion Spell Mask of the Shapeshifter is a Helmet in Baldur s Gate 3 Mask of the Shapeshifter is an exclusive item for players who have the Digital Deluxe Edition of Baldur s Gate 3 Helmets can be equipped to a character s head in their designated inventory slot and provide different effects ranging from increased Saving Throws to gaining Advantage on certain attacks The magic of this mask romesfrom its gory provenance and makes it perfertfor the disreming actor sleuth or person with a mirror and time to kill Mask of the Shapeshifter is only available if you buy the Digital Deluxe Edition of Baldur s Gate 3 This item is bugged as of 8 16 It makes all reactions except opportunity attack greyed out and untriggerable 0 0 Fane mask POG 2 0 pay 2 win 5 8 Fun fact about this item It tracks the data used during Character Creation for each race on that character So you can technically customize your disguise prior to getting the mask for every race Thin Female Male Thick Female Male Gnomes Half Orcs everyone you can select I was curious to see if it would given that the data for the transformation was exactly the same visual data shown during Character Creation Just be prepared for one super long slog of choosing what you want your transformations to look like The Origin Characters are stuck with the defaults outside of Mods Is this info worth anything Not really Is it oddly entertaining Very To break it down if you make a Custom Character and choose Gnome you get it all set up then decide to play a Drow instead The data you chose for the Gnome remains as the last data for the Mask to use when you use the Mask to transform into whatever gender Gnome you altered I m sincerely hoping this is a bug that s more of a feature that DOESN T get fixed Happened across three 3 different characters for me while I was testing this using High Elf Thin Female Male Thick Female Male and Wood Elf Thin Female Male Thick Female Male and choosing an Half Orc Dragonborn and Gnome as the played race If someone could confirm that this is the case for them as well that would be lovely 9 0 Search Results Mask of the Shapeshifter Baldurs Gate 3 Wiki Mask of the

Fextralife Recent Changes New page File Manager Members Page Manager Settings Create Wiki Back to top The Dark Urge is a special Origin in Baldur s Gate 3 it s only for custom characters and not related to any companions Origins grant your character particular interactions and adventures during your journey You remember nothing of your past besides that you walked a path paved with blood As you venture on you find yourself inescapably drawn towards unimaginable cruelties Where do these thoughts come from The Dark Urge has the following Starting Equipment During the Panel from Hell showcase it was revealed that The Dark Urge is the additional origin character that players can select in the Character Creation section of the game Unlike other Origin Characters The Dark Urge is a fully customizable Origin avatar where players can play as whichever Race Class appearance gender and overall build that they would like while maintaining the origin story of The Dark Urge The Dark Urge origin is also not associated with any Companions in Baldur s Gate 3 Customized The Dark Urge avatar selected by chat during the Panel of Hell showcase The Dark Urge is quite unique in Baldur s Gate 3 since the sequences and interactions that are featured are unexpected and it challenges your perception of how to tackle different situations As you choose to play the origin of The Dark Urge its history is unknown but you awaken to be someone who has dark thoughts that plague your mind and ultimately push you to commit atrocious acts throughout the journey The choice is completely yours will you fight what is twisting your mind to be good or will you succumb to madness and wreak chaos The Origin character of The Dark Urge cannot be recruited as a Companion It is exclusively selected during the Character Creation section of Baldur s Gate 3 where players customize the origin avatar and experience the path of The Dark Urge Players can change their class race and gender to whatever they want Yes you can run into a character in the game that is The Dark Urge where you can interact with but as mentioned this NPC that you ll eventually bump into cannot be recruited as a Companion Upon starting your journey with the origin of The Dark Urge the story will include a sinister voice of a narrator that speaks of the different impulses that are going on in your character s mind Guiding the Dark Urge in their time of need is Sceleritas Fel A vile and loyal servant Fel lives only to see the Dark Urge return to their rightful bloodstained path and urges them to commit some of the most lurid acts of violence This unique feature alone changes the many ways of interactions as well as cutscenes that you haven t seen and dialogues for you to choose from exclusive items and at length its origin story that unfolds As The Dark Urge we highly recommend that players enjoy every cutscene and dialogue there is available to it Yes the choice is completely yours if you play the origin of The Dark Urge Unlike any other characters or even the player s customized avatar the Dark Urge will have its own unique cutscenes and dialogue options for different scenarios and whatever you choose will result in different outcomes One example that was featured during the Panel from Hell showcase was during the exploration of a crash site with Shadowheart the player starts to loot the bodies of goblins and a cutscene triggers where the Narrator reminds you of how the sight of blood and violence gives you pleasure You then choose if you try to push the smile away to let that grin fall across your face or with enough Intelligence you try to remember the last time you stood above a corpse Another example is when Gale reaches his hand out from a portal and asks for help you are given unique choices such as fantasizing about cutting off the hand and by doing so your urges have led you to hacking off his hand With this you acquire Gale s severed hand which is a new branching point of interaction and scenarios that are unique and exclusive to The Dark Urge origin As you dive into its origin you ll learn what causes these twisted thoughts and experience the dark counterpoint of the game s main storyline The Dark Urge opens up with unique additional cutscenes interactions dialogues and results to the actions that you choose And with The Dark Urge you ll be thrown with evil thoughts and sinister actions that question your judgment or simply if you want to explore your darkest thoughts Some people may find this unappealing since they prefer to project their personality and beliefs towards the character they ve created but if you do play as The Dark Urge it is possible to use these ominous actions to your advantage The possibilities are endless here with the different situations and interactions you ll encounter If you find yourself in a difficult scene who knows the urges and thoughts of The Dark Urge can save you and your team or even turn the tides in your favor or if a terrible NPC is being difficult to deal with you have the option to be bad in return If you are choosing this origin it s best to analyze the different affairs and weigh the consequences that can occur Alfira gives u a pretty good robe as a reward in act 2 what happens to that item if u kill Alfira can u get it some other way 0 0 I had no option let Alfira stay at my camp 1 0 his unique ending is criminally underwhelming same as Minthara s death both in act 1 and act 2 break her mind really I want to ing dismember that like I even reloaded and saved her that is how bad it is Gale dies completely off screen pixie dies off screen after killing pixie your urges just stop there is not a single dark urge choice in act 3 not counting endings and Bhaal s trial I guess you can roleplay it because there are bad quest choices that are available to everyone but still all in all your options are very very limited and the amount of unique content that you get is absolutely not worth killing half of available origins and all available companions 0 0 From what i ve heard you don t have the compulsion to kill your lover if you do what the urge wants you to in act 2 but do you still have the option to do so anyway for shits and giggles I want to turn my DUrge into a solo run midway through in a way that feels natural 0 0 can you get the slayer form without having to kill isobel can you still go good after attaining it 1 0 Nothing happens when I visit Pandirna The Narrator just says In a secluded place all alone it would be too easy to do away with her Far beneath your talents 4 1 I knocked out Alfira I let Quill stay and killed my dark urge The next day Quill was dead inside some kind of ritual blood circle I revived my dark urge and took another long rest The butler said I missed my opportunity to kill her So it wasn t I that killed her apparently Didn t get any reward either 1 0 does anyone know where isobel goes if you let marcus kidnap her i want to kill her for the quest but im going insane searching for her after i sided with marcus 0 0 how do you get past the shadow cursed lands if kill the pixie 0 3 SPOILERS When you don t have him in your party he can be found in act 3 laying dead on the floor in Bhaal s Temple x102 y1005 17 11 If you have Animal Speak available you can avoid killing the squirrel Tested on an Oath of Ancients Paladin 4 1 Damn it urge I said I wanted to LAY with my lover not SLAY my lover 22 1 Sadly disguise seems to break interactions with it and make you act normally 8 2 What s y all s murderhobo class After my resist run I plan on doing an indulge run can t decide between gloomstalker oathbreaker or void monk though 7 2 are there any rewards for playing urge i only know about the Slayer form anything else some uniqe items or other abilities that you can get only as dark urge 16 7 are there any rewards for playing urge i only know about the Slayer form anything else some uniqe items or other abilities that you can get only as dark urge 7 4 Spoilers Kinda I mean if you read this thead then it isn t spoilers Can prevent Alfira s death for anothers that s another NPC that doesn t show up elsewhere so less guilt about it I hope you quicksave a lot If you get the event that has Alfira show up at camp reload your last save and go to the location Alfira sings at Turn on Non lethal damage and whack her until she s unconscious Just make sure she s not dead Go to camp and have a long rest A different NPC will show up at camp instead and goes through the Dark Urge storyline where you kill them instead in your sleep You have never met this NPC before Wake back up and Alfira is still alive and well even still talks to you 6 0 as someone who loves playing comically evil characters for sh t and giggles at least once this whole origin is like a dream come true lol 8 3 SPOILERS Does anyone know in Act 3 whether you can successfully resist the Dark Urge if you have given into it during miscellaneous events prior in the game Gamespot says two key events are killing the cleric in Act 2 and killing your lover both of which can be resisted unlike killing the Tiefling bard which is unavoidable apparently However if you ve tortured the bird in the grove things like that can you still get the resist ending in Act 3 0 1 No matter how hard I try happens at least when i m sleeping lol 0 0 The Dark Urge eventually lets you turn into slayer form but you have to kill off an entire village of useful NPCs quests to get it Pretty sure it has a significant impact on the story after act 2 but slayer form is actually sick 3 2 If you like playing with this seek help 15 77 When talking to goblin crusher at goblin camp you get the option to bite his toe off 4 1 Man the scene with Alfira is some next lvl trolling from the devs 7 1 Blood for the blood god 8 3 Could Shadowheart be the dark urge There is a scene at the selunite statue in the blighted village where she wigs out and says she had an urge to kill you but suppressed it 1 26 I wonder if the Dark Urge is somehow related to Bhaal 20 0 Does anybody know that as the Dark Urge is a semi custom character can you change the name i d like to play a dark urge character but I don t wanna be stuck with the dark urge name the whole game through Like how custom lets you go with Tav or whatever you want 6 4 I wonder if playing as the dark urge and trying to play them as good will still lead to a more interesting character in comparison to a non origin one 7 0 Murderhobo character Let s see how much we can please

DND player books and is subject to change A proud race that values clan and skills above all else Once enslaved by dragons they strive to be self sufficient not wanting to be beholden to anyone not even the gods Description one thing to note is that despite the tool tip indicating it s a cone bronze dragonborn s breath weapon is acutaly a column just like brass 0 0 breath is utterly useless 5 0 worst thing about the race is that it s not finished When playing a Dragonborn you have many conversations where you just have a continue instead different choices to answer It s completely not finished 0 4 Coolest looking race horrible abilities Why Why 8 1 I do hope Larian ends up tweaking the Dragonborn racial abilities slightly the resistance is nice but the breath ability is severely underwhelming A 2d6 breath ability that doesn t scale or gains any sort of improved version at later levels to be used only once per long rest is a tad dissapointing I hope they end up implementing Fizban s rules for the Dragonborn i e dragon breath does 1d10 damage at first then 2d10 after lvl 5 and 3d10 after lvl 11 as well as being useable a few more times per long rest 22 0 Is the breath bugged for anyone else No matter which ancestry I respec into it keeps giving me Frost Breath 3 2 Best one by far is Brass as it gives you a column breath attack rather then a cone more range more

Back to top Human is a Race in Baldur s Gate 3 Humans have a bonus racial speed While creating your Character in Baldur s Gate 3 you can choose between 11 different types of Races Each of them has their own special characteristics The most common face to see in Faerun humans are known for their tenacity creativity and endless capacity for growth Humans have no subraces How easy would be to balance Human race if they only added an extra feat for them 4 0 For Bretonnnia 1 0 There is not a single class in which humans are good at the third choice at best Neither are they good at multiclassing as it was in BG1 and 2 the case Just why 2 0 Nerf Hell In 5e the Human racial is a 1 to all abilities or the option for a 1 to two abilities a bonus skill AND a bonus feat A major advantage to this was selecting the Human racial feat Prodigy which then granted an additional skill a tool proficiency and a language as well as providing expertise in one skill you are proficient with The alternate racials offered here do not come anywhere close to balancing out this loss 7 0 I mean humans should be the most versatile class not the one that would be the third choice for all classes Any spellcaster would rather pick a half elf over a human The extra skill prof Doesn t make up at all for the actual bonuses given by 5ed Still even if humans are the underdog now At least fighters is are more usable It s a pity not being able to do aimed strikes aiming for a specific part of the body with a 6 malus to hit the manoeuvre precise strike loses its purpose imo 1 1 Not the strongest race for overall combat performance but I m loving the free proficiency and carry weight on my Fighter Allows me to be proficient in Persuasion which I wanted for my character and I m always near the encumbered weight so the 25 helps a lot Civil Militia is useful on classes that don t have light armor shield proficiency like WizardsWouldn t mind the free Feat at level 1 added to this race but with the exception that you can t pick Ability Improvements with it Also they look nice Big fan of the appearance my character has 2 1 Join me in the Make Humans not Suck again Campaign Larian Studios took a balanced race and nerfed it to the disparagement of many of their loving fans I hope they have the wisdom to correct this 1 Milita granting limited weapon armor and shield proficiencies is only good on single classed arcane casters making it increasingly redundant and even irrelevant on all the other classes Tossing in a single level of tempest cleric for example not only gives you ALL Weapon Armor proficiencies but also cool abilities access to more spells AND DOESN T Limit the number of spells you can cast as an arcane caster 2 Human Versatility skill The extra added skill is decent a bit better than those with a single added skill proficiency but not better than those with multiple added skills Wood elf perception stealth or especially the Githyanki who have Astral Knowledge which can give proficiency to as many as FIVE extra skills at a time The other part of Human Versatility increased weight allowance is LITERALLY THE WORST ABILITY IN THE GAME seeing as one can right click and send items to camp encumbrance should never be an issue It s Worthless Now take into account by comparison Half elves have the Milita weapon armor proficiencies but added darkvision charm saving throws can t be put to sleep Cantrips High Elf or Drow or increased movement with stealth Wood Elf This begs the question why select a human other than for RP purposes and why should a player be punished for doing so especially when those changes came at the expense of following the 5E rules What could Larian Studios do about this I d love to see the variant human in 5E rules with the Bonus Feat instead of human versatility and or Militia This gives flexibility so that humans could be decent in ANY role since Feats apply well to any class While a Feat is powerful keep in mind that it s not more powerful that many racial abilities such as multiple innate spells poison or fire resistance or the gith s ancestral knowledge ability and compared to these races humans still won t have dark vision or their other abilities proficiencies Please upvote for the Make Humans not suck again Campaign 20 3 Imagine not just playing the race class combo that s most fun to you in a roleplaying game If you want to play a human fighter go for it Not everything has to be minmaxed 3 2 Join me in the Make Humans not Suck again Campaign Larian Studios took a balanced race

punished for doing so especially when those changes came at the expense of following the 5E rules 10 4 Just like in Baldurs Gate 1 Baldurs Gate 2 and Icewind Dale on the AD D 2ed engine humans are trash Any other race is better than human in this game At least in that regard Larian is staying true to the sequel nature of this game 3 2 The human bonus skills is pretty good for picking up sleight of hand or persuasion on any class 0 0 they admitted they were butthurt that people were playing human fighters so it s not surprising they did what they did to the race 2 2 I think people are panicking too hard Sure humans aren t a good race for martial classes but shield proficiency is invaluble on the spellcasting classes that otherwise don t get it A sorcerer wizard can have 23 24 AC with mage armor and the shield spell and thats before factoring in any magical gear You d normally have to dip another class or take multiple feats to get this kind of unrivaled defense 2 2 so not even the bonus feat humans used to get it seems like other desperate for money games the newer a race class the more overpowered see githianky or how they are spelled compared to humans or dwarfes 6 22 Hyman is the best race it s carry capacity can really make it shine by carrying crates for your archers to stand on Also the can assist the far superior martial race the 3ft hobbit by throwing them at enemies with their increased carry capacityOr better yet they make great indentured servants able to help the better races with their one measly extra skill pretty sure bard gets like 6 skills on level 1 and by carrying lunch which the magically teleporting camp holds for free 6 3 It is disappointing that larian studios has abandoned the idea that half Orcs are inherently stronger than halflings and elves more intelligent than half Orcs I had hoped that they would choose the winding path of quiet reason rather than the crowded cobblestone of conformity 14 33 The ability to hold pointy sticks and carry more loot sounds more like a goblin thing tbh 24 0 Wow so you get dexterity based armor and strength based weapons neat 15 2 They choked so hard with this lolNot only is this extremely uninspired it also goes against everything that makes humans special The entire point of humans is that they can be everything but this Feat is literally worthless unless you re playing specifically a wizard or sorcerer and just refuse to multiclass into cleric out of principle I guess And least let us choose between Civil Militia and something else that would work for a martial like a simplified version of arcane initiate or something 28 1 Civil Militia is actually amazing on classes caster classes without light armor and shield proficiency easily worth a feat AI likes to target characters with lowest AC and half the enemies in act 1 had a bow or something to make it happen This racial translates to 4 to AC increasing to 10 as you find better gear If you wanted to roll a human fighter you re kinda ed though 5 8 They really did humans dirty here 30 0 We humans have to stick together 21 1 With tbe change to how stats are working did they give anything to humans They did say that we aren t getting the variant human at launch I give it a week before there is a mod for that but they didn t mention and I haven t seen anyone talk about what humans are getting Really right now absent of other information there is no reason to play a human 7 1 Humanity needs a buff 25 0 Welcome fellow Kings 25 1 Damn hope they add the human variant this one is kinda lacking when compared to the other races 33 0 I hope they consider merging Variant Human s ability to start with an extra skill and a feat baked into the overall human kit in this game I mean no one goes regular human whats the point Plus it gives the race a fitting and unique flavor I don t think extra movement stands too well on its own or really reflects humanity in 5e currently 43 0 Any chance the Human variant traits could be made available 2 floating ability points a skill and a feat 43 0 Search Results Human Baldurs Gate 3 Wiki Human Racial Features Subraces Human Traits Human Subraces Human Tips Notes

humans should be the most versatile class not the one that would be the third choice for all classes Any spellcaster would rather pick a half elf over a human The extra skill prof Doesn t make up at all for the actual bonuses given by 5ed Still even if humans are the underdog now At least fighters is are more usable It s a pity not being able to do aimed strikes aiming for a specific part of the

seem unfocused Why would I willingly sacrifice a potential 2 AC and proficiency with weapons and better racials that could help complete out a build that otherwise takes more effort to bring online as a tief Asmodeous Tieflings at least get some moderately useable skills Produce flame is a crappier light but you can t really argue with a free fire based evocation for blowing up barrels and any other sort of useage you could pair up mechanically with fire Mephistopheles Tieflings really get the short end with a skillset that seems unfocused and uncanny Mage hand is not really too useful in BG3 while Burning Hands isn t exactly a major prize to pine for Flame scimitar is similarly not really too interesting They really should ve just let you pick your own cantrip not too dissimilar to how elves work Zariel Tieflings can be potentially useable on some melee builds Thaumaturgy is also not a bad cantrip to have but far from necessary The smites aren t really anything to write home about though It s nothing that should really be tugging at people s heartstrings though It s a crying shame I love tiefs but boy did they get the short end of the stick here They re peak flavor Pretty

in a melee fight when built right and come with lots of support Utility Life focuses more on healing death prevention well Nature prefers crowd control with a squeeze of damage Light Knowledge These are caster clerics They both gain access to potent spell caster which allows them to add their wisdom modifier to damage cantrips making them more potent reliable Light goes all in on damage combat with things like burning hands fireball and their divine channel making it harder for enemies to hit them Knowledge gains access to lots of good crowd control with things like sleep slow Their divine channel also gives them a bonus on skill checks of a certain attributes War Tempest These are the clerics that love melee combat With training in Martial combat Heavy Armor they can wield weapons and armor no other cleric can without using up feats War focuses on being something of a commander with spells that buff themselves allies or both well also enjoying bonuses to striking with weapons Tempest on the other hand enjoys dealing elemental damage usually lighting to their foes at close range and disrupting foes at a distance well they close in Tempest also gains access to things like fog cloud sleet storm and freedom of movement allowing them to disrupt enemies well being hard to disrupt in turn Trickery This is perhaps the oddest of the domains It has utility in the form of blessing of the trickster allowing advantage on stealth checks and Invoke Duplicity which gives allies advantage on attacks made on enemies within 3m of the illusion you place It has disruption in the form of Fear and charm person and also has spells that help it in out of melee combat such as mirror image Dimension Door getting in out of melee If your willing to spend some gold to re spec Shadowheart a bit she can actually make a decent addition to your team 48 1 Divine Intervention at 10th level regardless of Domain Deity Choice when using the Arm Thy The gain a legendary weapon effect The only thing that is given is the Devotee s Mace On top of which you cannot reset your class and go Cleric again to reset the Divine Intervention feature as it trips a flag in the background that states You ve already used Divine Intervention on THIS character HOWEVER every party member can go Cleric and us the Army Thy Legendary Weapon effect to get the Devotee s Mace effectively giving a AoE 1D4 Heal for each Mace which are Simple Weapons so you can Dual Wield or Stick n Board with them across multiple characters Provided the user has the Dual Wielder Feat Is this worth it Probably not as by the time most players hit level 10 to do so you likely already have your gear set in stone Is it oddly humorous kinda My one lament is that they didn t give weapon variations for each of the Deities It s all Devotee s Mace with the same effect across the board As such it s actually better to save this big red button for one of the other effects in my opinion Tempus Selune Elistraeae Oghma All Devotee s Mace Hopefully this changes as time goes on Fairly early on into the full release though 3 2 Either I have a bug in my game or Heavy Armour Proficiency is missing here should be on the list 1 1 As someone who has played healers since Vanilla WoW all of Overwatch and in my multiple DnD campaigns I just really need the Grave Cleric at some point I d settle for Death Cleric and go more melee if I must but my empath emo heart needs my dark little healer 3 15 Without Spiritual Weapon the dps of this class lags behind others Dang It feels like they re pigeon holing classes into predefined roles 0 7 Harness Divine Power would be great 2 2 What is the deal with Gods Are they restricted to the domain 1 1 Life and light domain clerics This is my favorite DnD class because of their versatility I d love to see Tempest and Forge domain clerics make it into the game eventually I think 5e did a lot to keep them from being the dedicated healer and had enough alternatives to where they weren t responsible for healing the entire party There are something like 12 cleric domains you can currently only pick from 3 and 2 of them being fairly similar is a bit disappointing That s early access though right 8 13 Are all the domains actually available on the early access 5 2 Life cleric has Knowledge cleric spells for some reason I assume it s just a mistake and needs to be

lots of support Utility Life focuses more on healing death prevention well Nature prefers crowd control with a squeeze of damage Light Knowledge These are caster clerics They both gain access to potent spell caster which allows them to add their wisdom modifier to damage cantrips making them more potent reliable Light goes all in on damage combat with things like burning hands fireball and their divine channel making it harder for enemies to hit them Knowledge gains access to lots of good crowd control with things like sleep slow Their divine channel also gives them a bonus on skill checks of a certain attributes War Tempest These are the clerics that love melee combat With training in Martial combat Heavy Armor they can wield weapons and armor no other cleric can without using up feats War focuses on being something of a commander with spells that buff themselves allies or both well also enjoying bonuses to striking with weapons Tempest on the other hand enjoys dealing elemental damage usually lighting to their foes at close range and disrupting foes at a distance well they close in Tempest also gains access to things like fog cloud sleet storm and freedom of movement allowing them to disrupt enemies well being hard to disrupt in turn Trickery This is perhaps the oddest of the domains It has utility in the form of blessing of the trickster allowing advantage on stealth checks and Invoke Duplicity which gives allies advantage on attacks made on enemies within 3m of the illusion you place It has disruption in the form of Fear and charm person and also has spells that help it in out of melee combat such as mirror image Dimension Door getting in out of melee If your willing to spend some gold to re spec Shadowheart a bit she can actually make a

Baldur s Gate 3 Monks primary ability is Dexterity Wisdom their saving throw proficiencies are Strength Dexterity and they have a Hit Dice of 1d8 per monk level They have proficiency with Simple weapons shortswords and with None Monks in DnD are inspired by the Monastic traditions of Tibet and are the newest addition to the Baldur s Gate 3 roster They were officially revealed just before the official release of the game and were not available during the Early Access of the game Developers wanted to have different approaches which introduce the 3 Subclasses Way of the Open Hand Way of Shadow and Way of the Four Elements which are each distinct interpretations of what a Monk means The Monk in Baldur s Gate 3 will focus on different Kung Fu abilities that will vary in style across the different subclasses from elemental abilities and Spells to ninja like combat actions In Baldur s Gate 3 Monks employ a unique gameplay Actions mechanic These Actions mimic spell effects but their distinctive feature lies in their consumption of Ki Points Channel your cosmic enlightenment by deftly dodging and efficiently disassembling your foes through stunning strikes and a whirlwind of martial art attacks Game changer information You don t need to be unarmed offhand to punch so you can dual wield weapon to have effect of them 0 0 Unarmored defense of monk and barb do not stack me sad 3 4 Monk is really OP right now wiith tavern brawler feat and I absolutely love it but their class related dialogues are boring as hell too much pacifist for my tastes 10 7 I saw a book about way of the sun soul that was completely empty somewhere in a basement in Baldur s Gate I think this means that the class was cut for final release and might be accesible in a future patch 5 7 Way of the Shadow becomes more potent after gaining Shadow Step at level 6 Ah yes the floor here is made out of floor of course your subclass becomes more potent after getting a subclass feature that s with EVERY SINGLE SUBCLASS Who even wrote this 16 37 This site sucks so much balls Seriously no listing for monk at levels 11 and 12 has noone picked it 11 18 can confirm tavern brawler is added to bonus unarmed attack in full version 1 0 1 War Domain Cleric 11 Open Hand Monk Use Divination Wizard to Haste use a Haste Potion but you only got 3 turns of it and Divine Favor before battle Wholeness of body in any round you want Next round you can attack 7 times Flurry of Blows topple and Stunning Strike If enemy succeeds use Portent if you have any low rolls to make them fail Advantage on all attacks and completely skips their turn of combat Bosses in Act2 and Act3 couldn t even move and huge chunks of their health bars disappeared on Tactician lol 3 1 At Lv9 your unarmed dice go from 1d6 to 1d8 should be another upgrade at Lv12 to 1d10 I assume 3 0 Eldritch initiate is a good feat if you re not putting many points in Wisdom Get the level 1 Hex spell from the warlock spell list and use it make enemies roll disadvantage against your abilities Hex also persists between fights 0 6 Wood elf monk baby Longsword as a monk weaponSuper speed2 bonus skills that match your attribute investment dexterity and wisdom Go glass cannon tavern brawling monk level 12 open hand str 18 dex 14 con 12 int 8 Wis 20 Cha 8 double that strength bonus for unarmed chef s kiss 1 1 Wood elf monk be like nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeoooooommmmmmmmmmmm I m fast as fk boiiiiiiii 6 7 High Dex Higher AC harder to be hit while also having a good accuracy and damage High Str Probably bound to open hand tavern brawler your accuracy and damage now rolls by Str with an extra dice from tavern bralwer which is bound to Str rolls High Wis Maybe you re multiclassing gives a bit of AC from monk passive maybe you re boosting a little more elemental damage from way of the open hand lv6 Please don t blame people s build being terrible advices the game just came out the website information is out of date the rules of how things apply or not apply is not crystal clear respec is only 100 gold away and there s always save load it s not like theres no return I m a Lv7 monk with Str20 Dex16 Con12 Wis14 open hand tavern brawler at act 2 playing with a group of 4 players tank bard cleric monk my role is like an assassin which does insane damage to enemies I m never into battle first mostly in last after enemies are locked into combat then I stealth in I have huge issues on sustaining since my AC is only 17 with a Con12 while the rest of the team is like 20 I m literally glass cannon Since my main damage output comes from bonus action s flurry of blows I m thinking on ending as a Monk8 Rogue4 Thief so I d get another bonus action to boost my damage Though my AC is a big worry but as long as the team works fine there s no trouble at the moment 4 0 I m about to stop using fextralife for any information about this game and other games Half the time I m not sure if the information is just a guess or not from 5e Other times I find wiki information that is flat out wrong You are better off getting information from some random journalist on a gaming website If I ever come back to this site hopefully I will see fextralife getting their act together Also the comments are often misleading and they might as well be a reddit argument thread Only good thing I ready on this whole page is that you can use a bonus action to unarmed strike while using wild shape 51 13 So much bad advice here Open Hand STR monk is easily S tier in damage and mobility with infinite super jumps Go monk until 7 then respec to cleric 1 monk 6 11 Wear heavy armor shield and get tavern brawler feat only use punches and throwing You can do the same with Shadow Monk but you lose an extra 5 damage per punch and you are punching a lot so it adds up The teleport is fun though Also you can get a ring that makes you immune to blindness so you don t need to multi warlock if you want to see in magic darkness 9 17 I ve found pieces of great gear for a monk really boosting its damage potential by adding elemental damage on unarmed attacks and adding your wisdom on damage rolls Can it be that monk is very gear dependant and will be a powerhouse once you collect these pieces of gear Cause compared to paladin a class that has more utility even the damage from monk is lackluster 4 1 Warning this tip is a trap Hold off on multi classing your Monk until after level 5 to access their extra attack feature which significantly boosts your damage potential Why Monk is fun but bad class The best monk you can get is a monk that is not starting as a monk So real tip should be Weaponize your Wisdom score And you can do it by multiclassing into Cleric Nature or Tempest or a Druid One of best build i can think of is Race pick Deep gnome better darkvision and advantage on mental saving throws Wood elf Half orc Ability scores 16dex 16wis 14 con Fighter as level 1 Dueling fighting style so you can grab dex weapon and wear armor shield until you become monk then at Level 2 pick Nature Cleric Shillelagh so your start hitting with a stick Thorn Whip Sacred flame and after that go all monk pick whatever Subclass you want At level 4 of a monk take Polearm Master or Warcaster feat and you are officially golden By having cantrips you do not lose much in terms of damage and have much better ranged attacks than regular monk You also have better saving throws way to heal yourself and allies and also some ways of battlefield control Just by not starting as a Monk and taking a dip into 1 level Cleric or a Druid 2 22 Still hoping for Way of Mercy monk 8 3 Still hoping for Way of Mercy monk 6 4 I wish it was possible to build an effective strength monk and also fist weapons like gauntlets or claws would ve been nice 6 4 Open hand monk gains free bonus damage in the form of necrotic physic or radiant only one at a time for unarmed attacks starting at level 6 Hen you also add the ki restoration which give you an additional bonus action for 3 turns your api and dps go up like crazy At that level I could safely ditch using a weapon although you might have better weapons if you picked up a specific proficiency like pole arms with human race 3 0 Does anybody know how the unarmed strike damage scales with level From other sources screenshots and videos posted elsewhere I know that it goes to a d6 at level 3 remains d6 at least until level 6 and becomes a d8 by level 9 I assume it won t reach d10 before the level cap but I am curious as to the precise level when it becomes a d8 4 4 What should be the best between Human Monk start from 10 16 16 10 15 9 to 10 20 16 10 16 10 or Wood Elf Monk start from 10 17 14 10 15 8 to 10 22 14 10 16 8 4 2 If you multi class Druid can the monk use unarmed strike while in Wild Shape 13 2 for the game is it a mod or is monk already in patch 9 bec i dont see it same with the blood urge 0 5 Keen to make a 20 Dex 20 Wis Monk and not get by anything Although it requires bargaining with the Hag which feels very out of place 0 2 Where is the extra ki and house rules they mentioned that would be to make the class worth playing Beacuse this seams like the same terrible class from the 5e phb 8 5 Sigh The monk is always the forgotten and neglected stepchild of the Dungeons and Dragons world 16 2 i dont understand in this stupid 5 edition monks are unarmed fighters or not becaus in good old bg1 2 monks get increased unarmed damage by levels and fist 1 2 3 4 and I dont see anything here excemp ki empowerd and flurry of blow but what about unarmed scalling by level magical fist 2 3 4 4 8 Best class for gachi domination on a battlefield 8 0 I really hope this class is legit 5 0 Slight worry that hopefully will be resolved on launch Quarterstaff In game currently counts as a 2 handed and not versatile weapon therefore wouldn t count as a monk weapon since they must be single handed 2 9 I hope other subclasses comes through 3 0 When this class will be added I bought at launching day and only 6 basic classes were available 5 38 Search Results Monk Baldurs Gate 3 Wiki Monk Subclasses Way of the

proficiencies are Wisdom Charisma and they have a Hit Dice of 1d10 per paladin level They have proficiency with Simple Weapons Martial Weapons and all Armor and Shields The Paladin class offers an excellent experience for roleplaying as players can experience changing their subclass through their subsequent actions Players will face scenarios where they will be tempted to embrace the dark side as they struggle to uphold their Oaths and deal with the consequences of being branded as an Oathbreaker For Paladins their Oaths are sacred to them and this is why they can choose their subclass immediately on Character Creation In combat Paladins are able to provide great support to their allies that can help them gain an edge in battle Oathbreakers will have the same abilities as their original Subclass but will gain new and sinister capabilities Fuelled by the Oaths you swore to uphold justice and righteousness you are a beacon of hope in dark times You can search by Name Level School and Casting Time Just type into the search box what you are looking for Quick Search of All Spells If you re worried of breaking your oath just let your companion make the morally grey dialogue choice and you re safe 0 0 I think you re actually better off monoclass than going warlock 4 for example Darkness and devils sight isn t working like it s supposed to Vengence paladin can self haste at 9 and get improved divine smite at 11 Plus it s way easier to boost strength than CHA you can get strength to 24 26 easily and possibly higher So attacking with strength is actually better than charisma But still both are good 3 0 Is it worth grabbing 1 level in Wizard after hitting Level 5 Paladin to add another 2 Level 1 slots I just want to SMITE 0 0 oh boy time to play paladin aaaaaaaaand oathsbroken 8 1 Extra attack stacks with Warlock s pact of the blade extra attack giving you 3 smites every turn you are welcome 5 1 DEUS VULT 9 7 Wiki s classes and subclasses section on this page is a straight copy paste of their elden ring one lol Astrologer or Samurai would definitely be interesting classes in BG3 though 1 0 wtf I killed a grandmother in front of her family and it broke my oath what is this railroad bs 13 2 Remember your Oath when you interact with people The game will not tell you if something will break your oath so always keep those tenets in the back of your mind Unless you want Oathbreaker then just do the exact opposite of your oath as soon as possible and give the biggest shrug possible to your order 14 0 Protip you CAN T respec an Oathbreaker pally unless you take back up your oath 1k gold for me in act 1 so make sure you are careful 8 0 should i keep on the path of normal paladin of vengence or would people recommend to multiclass into something else 1 2 Hello Great Class Just some feed back on the 2nd Act I feel like Paladin s should be given more tools to fight darkness a bit more effectively than what is avalible at around lvl 4 5 Blindsmite is good and all but there should be a skill similar to cleric s Spirit Guardian ability that shines holy light for 2 3 turns and deals damage to creatures that is Evil Dark excluding undead etc Organic creatures 0 8 I love how 5e specifically had much more relaxed oaths because the overly rigid lawful stupid paladins of earlier editions were dreadful only for us to come full circle as the bg3 community comes out of the woodwork to praise en masse a system that serves to restrict player agency and roleplay inb4 murderhobo because there s a lot of evil you have to allow by implication just because the developers didn t think about the logistics of a particular plot beat Do note that the stupidity of a system that rigidly demands the letter of the law be obeyed and not its spirit in a medium that depends entirely on the chaos of human motives abstract imaginative thought is in summary largely why the tabletop abandoned everyone s new favorite forced roleplay tool 7 42 Anyone else think that Paladin class is lacking in powerful high level skills features The spells and the auras doesnt seem to be that great especially if the aura is so small 3m and you have shadowheart in your party If the information on this page is right I think multiclassing is the way to go after level 5 so you get the extra attack ASAP Action surge from fighter class would fit nicely maybe even get a fighter subclass for superiority die attacks or get barbarian rage or rogue additional bonus action The options are many One example With 5 levels in paladin 2 in fighter and 2 3 in rogue barbarian you would get loads of attacks per turn with Great Weapon Mastery feat or Berserker Frenzy even the bonus action attacks are as powerful as regular action attacks 5 8 What is the point of having subclasses in this game when you will sooner or later end up as and Oathbreaker any way because of way how oath sistem works in this game 4 33 bro these doofus at fextra recommend you multiclass paladin and rogue so you can get extra bonus actions to smite twice per turn LOL 13 13 Charisma and wisdom affect spell of not saving throw 0 2 Find Steed tho 10 0 Uuuuh will they add Oath

you can just melee attack and use Divine Smite if you want To do this hit L on the keyboard and tick each level of Divine Smite On and to Ask This will allow you to use Divine Smite with other Weapon Actions Opportunity Attacks as well as Smite Spells Using the Dueling fighting style maximizes damage while using a one handed weapon and a shield Duelling is particularly good if you are out of Spell Slots and cannot Divine Smite Defence is also a great choice of Fighting Style since most Paladin damage comes from Divine Smite anyway Oath of Vengeance subclass offers more versatility for making morally ambiguous decisions while Oathbreaker allows the player to choose whatever decisions he or she wants both good and evil Multiclassing at level 2 or 6 are ideal for Paladin because at level 2 you can bring Divine Smite and all your Proficiencies to another Class while at level 6 you gain Extra Attack and Aura of Protection which are both fantastic Paladins in BG3 use Charisma for Aura of Protection and Dialogue mostly but it does increase they number of Spells they can Prepare There are very few hostile Paladin Spells that require high Charisma though so don t pump Charisma thinking you will need it for these types of Spells unless you know which they are and you ve planned ahead You can completely dump Dexterity and use Heavy Armour for protection on your Paladin and you won t gain the 1 penalty to AC at 8 DEX thanks to the way Heavy Armour works Remember that Duelling doesn t work with Versatile Weapons unless paired with a shield so using a Longsword alone is not ideal on a Paladin using this Fighting Style Extra Attack only provides a second Attack if you used your Action to Attack to begin with You cannot cast a spell and then attack or attack and then cast a spell And Extra Attack doesn t stack with other Classes that have Extra Attack Anonymous21 Aug 2023 02 36 If you re worried of breaking your oath just let your companion make the morally grey dialogue

and Medium Armour The Ranger class is a classic character from Dungeons Dragons and has been a part of Baldur s Gate 3 since Early Access Today Rangers continue to explore the world of Faerun with their superior hunting skills and natural ability to thrive in the harshest wildest climates amidst the flora and the fauna Rangers are traditionally regarded as simple characters able to traverse the wilds with their timeless weapon of choice the bow and arrow In Baldur s Gate 3 Rangers are able to take a step further mastering their control over wild beasts completing their skills of the hunt and even tempering themselves in the darkest environments eventually learning how to go beyond the material and cast specialized Spells Rangers have their own list of Spells and Features accessible to them through leveling up the character They have the option to choose their path to undertake once they reach Level 3 Rangers are unrivalled scouts and trackers honing a deep connection with nature in

in levels Due to the Animal Companion I ve mostly gotten the consensus I should dedicate the bulk of if not all of my levels into Ranger to maximize it s effectiveness but I m not sure if 1 2 levels into one of those specific classes for multi classing would hurt it enough to be noticeable in game And if so outside of just class dialogue flavor would Sorcerer or Warlock be better than the other to use or would it just be a matter of personal preference and whether I wanted Eldritch blast or not 0 0 so can i cast a spell on arrows 4 4 I chose Ranger Knight but didn t get the Heavy Armor

to hide and gain advantage for Sneak Attack using ranged attacks or well timed movement to capitalize on it The Arcane Trickster is one of the three available subclasses for the Rogue the other two being the Thief and the Assassin The Arcane Trickster could be basically explained as a Rogue that has the ability to cast up to level 2 Spells This gives the Arcane Trickster a vast array of abilities an uncommon item that can be found in the Blighted Village can be extremely useful for Arcane Tricksters Especially if their Intelligence isn t too high While wearing the Warped Headband of Intelligence the Intelligence ability is set to 17 Knowing this beforehand allows players to dump Intelligence to a low level in character creation and use the remaining points in other Abilities At level 9 Arcane Tricksters learn Magic Ambush While hidden Arcane Trickster targets have Disadvantage on Saving Throws against their Spells Given the nature of Rogues of attacking from the shadows Magic Ambush is a great feature to have Choose Assassin for automatic advantage against enemies who haven t acted yet facilitating Sneak Attack triggers The Assassin is the more DPS focused subclass of the Rogue being able to deal massive burst damage on a single attack Especially effective against unprepared Enemies and also against creatures that haven t taken a turn yet At level 3 Assassins learn Assassinate Initiative which grants them Advantage on Attack Rolls against creatures that haven t taken a turn yet At level 3 Assassins learn Assassinate Ambush which make any successful Attack Roll against a Surprised creature a Critical Hit At level 3 Assassins learn Assassin s Alacrity which immediately restores Actions and bonus actions at the start of combat Making Assassins always ready for a fight Gloves of Missile Snaring are a good defensive piece of equipment Rogues can equip They possess the ability to reduce damage from ranging attacks by 1d10 the Rogue s Dexterity Modifier Elegant Studded Leather grants 2 to Initiative rolls granting Assassins the chance to exploit their early combat burst damage as soon as possible The Thief in a way is the most common and expected perception of a Rogue a nimble and agile character that benefits from hiding and moves around the battlefield freely At level 3 the Thief learns Fast Hands which grants a second Bonus Action for every turn Having more options on each turn is incredibly beneficial granting them the possibility to move further on the battlefield heal by consuming a potion disengage from combat or hide in the shadows Thanks to all three available cunning actions Cunning Action Hide Cunning Action Dash and Cunning Action Disengage this second bonus action allows thieves to have further options at their disposal At level 3 thieves also learn Second Story Work receiving resistance to falling damage It is not a game changing ability but may come useful in certain scenarios At level 9 the Thief learns Supreme Sneak which is an action that allows the thief to become completely invisible Useful for escaping and repositioning or attacking from the shadows dealing massive damage Note that attacking will break the invisibility Español España Pícaro On Save Targets still take half damage On Miss The shard of ice still explodes On Save Targets still take half damage 5mCON Save INT Anonymous19 Aug

spells from spellbooks Sorcerers possess an innate connection to magic usually through their bloodline ancestry or some other mystical source This innate power allows them to cast Spells without the need for preparation or study Sorcerers can cast spells using their Charisma as their spellcasting ability Sorcerers are natural spellcasters drawing on inherent magic from a gift or bloodline You can

at lvl 1 as Draconic Bloodline it says here Wild Magic only secondly after arriving on the coast for some bloody reason i had Tasha s Hideous Laughter as a prepared spell NOT a scroll haven t even found one yet Using Twinned Spell on Witch Bolt and hitting 2 beefy creatures successfully concentration auto fails on both of them i hit bugbear and warg it said concentration lost twice listing bugbear twice replicated it again after a few loads to see wtf is going on this should work i googled dnd 5e reddit for this 4 1 The HP information seems to be off I believe you get 6 CON HP at 1st level and 4 CON every level thereafter unless you are a Draconic Sorcerer which gives you an extra point per level 3 5 It would be great if they allowed you to try other bloodlines in addition to these listed here when they add this class But if not that is ok I love the dragon bloodline 13 dex ac is to mage armor I can save that spell known die something else like magic missile or familiar 1 0 Most of this is just copied from normal DnD rules but I do hope the Wild Magic is going to be a thing in Baldur s Gate 3 I believe it was in 2 and I do love me some random madness 5 2 Not sure how I feel about the game can have you roll a d20 When i played this my DM never had me roll Would be nice to know the odd of the game making u roll Ultimately it s a percentage chance to have you try for a

max level spell slots stop at 5 1 0 i thought warlocks were spellcasters why do they only get two spell slots until level eleven 3 2 Be careful when multi classing into warlock if your primary class is a full caster It seems that your warlock spells will be locked to your highest spell slot and those first level will be unaccessible to your warlock spell slots For example I have two warlock levels and five bar levels and I can only cast hex using my third level spells Hopefully this gets fixed 5 0 I really dont see any reason to get to level 12 of Warlock except for pact of the blade You get eldritch invocation that gives bonus damage on Melee attacks which i doubt you ever actually want to do as a spellcaster 1 7 There s a weird thing where the game will often refuse to use Warlock Spell Slots before normal ones which is annoying as I want to first use the slots that I can recharge 2 0 So some bugs with Pact of the Chain currently far as I can tell at level 5 the pet doesn t change at all Supposedly supposed to be buffed I noticed no difference from the level 3 version Though Chain does get Access to Fireball where as Tome doesn t so there s that Also it might be a good idea to inform people what Warlock spells scale with level as Warlock spellslots automatically upgrade to higher level but you only ever have 2 slots until 11th level For instance Hellish Rebuke scales Armor of Agathys scales but Hex does not 7 1 So what do you do Eldritch Blast What are you good at Eldritch Blast What are your hobbies Casting Eldritch Blast with repelling blast for funny kills Oh and also consorting with powerful ancient entities For Is it for El Eldritch Blast 29 1 i only have 2 cantrips at level 4 am I missing something 0 2 Do warlocks not get extra blasts 12 5 Warlock lvl 5 spells and stuff no 7 0 For pact of the blade please just add the hexblades hex warrior to it It is REALLY REALLY bad otherwise even with thirsting blade etc 6 25 do warlocks get to interact with their patron at all 7 3 Since I waiting for Larian to add Paladin class I also wonder if they add Celestial Warlock subclass at least in the final game 6 2 I hope they will add the halfling from ebberron and the celestial patron and all the invocation this seem to be a game made from the 5 edition rules there is so much that can be put in the game and tasha s cauldron just came out omg I m totally gonna buy it when it is out 7 5 Hi is there any word about blast shapes and at what level would we get them spear should be low level and useful in this game and having a cone cantrip every round makes it worth it till you hit doom blast at lvl 9 2 7 To Larien For Warlocks other 2 pacts being added for release 2 1 Warlocks are kind of boring with only one short rest per long rest That is just not enoughEven wizards with arcane recovery get their spell slots back once a day I understand the limit but it should be AT LEAST twice per long rest or even three times 30 5 no pact boons Seems really simple to add the 3 pacts from a gameplay perspective Chain is just find familiar Blade is just proficiency and weapon spawning and tome is just more cantrips 17 4 Please add Hexblade patron as well I think its a great magical warrior class and makes Pact of the Blade very meaningful 53 11 These are literally just rules from the Players Handbook 7 4 Sooo where does this spell table come from Because on DND Beyond and Roll20 the Warlock get s his 3rd Level Spells on Class Level 5 and 5th Level Spells on Class Level 9 But on this table the Warlock is unlocking 3rd Level Spells on Class Level 11 and doesn t even get to 5th Level at all As the game is supposed to only let us level until Level 10 the Warlock isn t getting 3rd Level So please Is this officially

offensive spells and a health restoring feature upon defeating enemies aiding in your character s survival Cast Hex for extra damage and recast it after killing an enemy to maintain sustained bonus damage without consuming additional spell slots Leverage Eldritch Blast as a primary damage dealing option enhancing it with Agonizing Blast and Repelling Blast invocations for increased damage and battlefield control Eldritch Blast with the aforementioned enhancements can be a game changer specially in places where there are chasms or against enemies that can be pushed from a high place to the ground dealing massive damage Gemini Gloves are an incredible option to boost Eldrich Blast thanks to the Adroit Caster ability which lets the wearer s cantrips target one more enemy or ally Misty Step is another incredible good combination for repositioning and gaining Advantage with Eldritch Blast Counterspell will allow you to control the field and prevent enemies from casting powerful Spells by spending a reaction If you rely heavily on Eldritch Blast for offensive and don t use many Spells saving those spell slots for Counterspell will waste many turns of the enemies Counterspell can be paired with Staff of Spellpower thanks to its powerful ability Arcane Battery which allows you to don t spend a spell slot on the next spell casted You can bind any melee weapon to you as your Pact weapon if you chose Pact of the Blade allowing you to attack with your Charisma Modifier with it Pact of the Blade Extra Attack is not supposed to stack with other Extra Attacks per the description but seems to currently Hunger of Hadar is an amazing spell that can be used both for area denial but also deal damage and crowd control at the same time War Caster or Resilient CON are both good choices of Feats to help you maintain Concentration of spells like Hunger of Hadar Darkness or Cloud of Daggers Warlocks can multiclass well with Paladin Sorcerer or Bard since they all use Charisma to cast their Spells as well Warlocks will most likely Multiclass after level 3 or level 9 depending on what class they are multiclassing since they are very front loaded Warlock Spell Slots don t level up any higher when multiclassing so if you want stronger Spell Slots you ll need to keep taking levels in Warlock Warlocks can wear Medium Armour and use a Shield and still cast spells if they have Proficiency in these from their Race or other Class if they Multiclassed and really should since it helps beef up their AC Eldritch Blast gains a second beam at level 5 and third beam at level 10 This is character level though not Warlock level allowing you to multiclass and still have a powerful Eldritch Blast Anonymous19 Aug 2023 05 46 does pact of the blade for for thrown

protection and minimal Weapon Proficiencies making them lean on their spells to support their party The Wizard is a spellcasting class in Dungeons Dragons and it also plays a significant role in Baldur s Gate 3 Wizards are distinguished by their extensive knowledge of arcane magic which they acquire through rigorous study and the mastery of ancient tomes and spellbooks Unlike Sorcerers who possess innate magical abilities Wizards rely on their intellect discipline and education to cast spells They delve into ancient texts meticulously transcribing and memorizing magical formulae into their spellbooks Through this scholarly process Wizards gain access to a diverse range of spells and the flexibility to prepare different ones each day tailoring their magical arsenal to suit specific challenges Wizards master the arcane by specialising in individual schools of magic combining ancient spells with modern research All Wizards gain access to the following progression regardless of
